       "     'text': 'The opening salvos in a trade war initiated by the current U.S. administration are already having an impact on all the manufacturing sectors in Canada, the U.S and around the world, most of it negative.\\n\\nFor example, it’s been announced that Harley Davidson, that icon of U.S. brands, feels it’s necessary to move some of its U.S.-based production to Europe to avoid countervailing duties leveled against the U.S. by the EU — a move which has drawn public criticism from the U.S. president via his usual medium, Twitter.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nSo, how has that general upheaval in the order of things affected ag equipment manufacturers in Canada? CG caught up with Leah Olson, president of the Agricultural Manufacturers of Canada (AMC), at Canada’s Farm Progress Show in Regina in June and asked her what the association’s members are saying. Here’s how the conversation went.\\n\\nQ. What is the ag equipment industry saying about the steel and aluminum tariffs?\\n\\nA. We’re very concerned. The repercussions of that on the industry are price increases. Some of the ag equipment manufacturers in Canada have longer-term contracts, so they can continue to have those (steel prices) respected. But for those that don’t, they’ve started to try and increase their inventory. With supply and demand, steel prices are going up. We anticipate prices won’t necessarily hit all farm equipment and farmers in the same way. Some manufacturers are looking at ways they can contain costs so they are cushioning farmers from higher prices. For others, that may not be possible.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAt this time what AMC is doing is talking to the Canadian government. We continue to encourage them to avoid tariffs. We don’t believe that any form of protectionism will help consumers or the ag industry. We believe that at a time like this, particularly for the U.S. ag industry, this will hit them hard. We have been working with AEM (The Association of Equipment Manufacturers) to ensure that our voices on both sides of the border are heard. Our key messages are very consistent.\\n\\nWe’re worried.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAs soon as Trump announced his intention to introduce tariffs, there were already reports of rising steel prices. Is that what manufacturers have seen?\\n\\nThere’s been a lot of business uncertainty as a result of what’s been talked about at the political level. Business enjoys knowing what the rules are and when they’re going to be enforced. So in early March when the administration originally announced the tariffs, that caused mayhem. Canada and Mexico were exempted, and we were grateful for that, but the damage to business confidence was already done. So from that perspective steel and aluminum manufacturers were already preparing for something that was going to happen. I think right now we’re seeing a lot of speculation and a lot of hope that tariffs will not be put into place permanently. But that unknown is what’s hurting our members and hindering their abilities to make decisions on how much steel do they buy, what is the price they’re buying at and looking at other input costs, because steel is only one element of inputs to farm equipment. They are looking at other elements they could change and cushion the price (increase) to the end user.\\n\\nIs this also affecting manufacturers’ willingness to invest in facilities or make other capital investments? Are plans being put on hold, because of the tariffs?\\n\\nI think for manufacturers that were looking at big capital expenditures, those decisions have been put on hold or on ice for the time being, just to see where all this is going to end up. That said, many of our manufacturers have increased their employment, they are investing. This is at a time when we’re seeing some real optimism in the industry. But the actions of the U.S. administration and the Canadian government’s quick and timely response add a bit of uncertainty. Overall, though, I think the industry will continue growing. And our hope is this will be a short-term blip. But that’s not something we can control.\\n\\nGiven that China, a major buyer of U.S. agricultural commodities, has announced retaliatory duties on products that could affect the pocketbooks of American farmers, is there actually a possibility the equipment industry could be looking at a downturn if tariffs remain in place?\\n\\nIf tariffs become permanent, one of the first industries to be hit will be the farm equipment manufacturing industry in both Canada and the U.S. We’re not the big auto industry that has had a lot of experience with the government in terms of subsidies. Our industry tends to be located in smaller, rural areas and we’re very export oriented, with the U.S. being a big market. If U.S. farmers are not able to invest in new equipment, then yes. We will see our profitability and sales go down. There are lots of opportunities in other markets, but my worry is if tariffs become permanent, is the industry that will be hit the most is the farm equipment manufacturing industry in Canada and the U.S.\\n\\nDo manufacturers have any idea yet how much prices will rise based on what they are paying for steel and aluminum now?\\n\\nIt really is dependent on the size of the manufacturer and their relationship with the steel producers. In Ontario, manufacturers there have seen and felt their prices go up quite a bit quicker and more drastically than those in Western Canada. I think that’s just because of the relationship they have with producers. That said, we realize farmers are our customers and prices of farm equipment have already been rising because of R+D, testing and new product development, and the industry, writ large, will be looking at ways they can cushion the farmer. But we realize there will be instances where that’s not possible.\\n\\nI know one of the major brands had already announced price increases in early June. That was on a Monday. Then the administration announced the tariffs and Canada gave their timely response as well. That was on the Thursday. So we’re already seeing price increases that have nothing to do with the tariffs from some of the mainlines.\\n\\nPeople generally support our federal government’s response to the U.S. tariffs by imposing countervailing duties, but in a practical sense, will that also serve to push up manufacturers’ costs?\\n\\nI think the Canadian government was put in a very awkward position. They had to respond. Our industry believes trade can and should be happening. It helps the agriculture industry, therefore it helps consumers. Concerning the counter tariffs the Canadian government put in place, we applaud the speed of their response, and we are encouraging them to get back to that NAFTA table and talk to the U.S. administration in the way that they have been and try and get those tariffs eliminated.\\n\\nAre there opportunities to source inputs from Canadian steel suppliers and avoid tariffs?\\n\\nOur supply chains are very intertwined between Canada and the U.S., whether you’re in western Canada, Quebec or Ontario, the supply chains are tight. So it’s hard to determine if tariffs are going to hurt Canada more or the U.S. Because some of our members in the U.S. are buying steel from Canadian producers, they’re going to get hit. If it comes back to Canada as an unfinished good, it comes back at a higher price. Ag equipment has flowed back and forth without tariffs. So this is the first time many of our members have had to deal with them.\\n\\nIf there was an understanding of how intertwined the industry is, perhaps those (tariff) decisions wouldn’t have been made. But it will hurt.\\n\\nPreviously, some manufacturers have dealt with rising steel prices through the use of a surcharge added to the MSRP. Is that a possibility going forward?\\n\\nI haven’t heard of that being discussed. Manufacturers are trying to be transparent about what’s happening in their industry. So when you have a major input cost and it is 100 percent out of your control, you have to take that somewhere. So I would anticipate some of our members may be contemplating that. The ideal situation would be that in the next week everyone realizes no one is going to gain from tariffs and everyone comes back to the table.\\n\\nAre there other markets that can replace any slump in demand from U.S. buyers?\\n\\nWe are an export industry; in 2017 Canadian ag implement manufacturers exported over $1.9 billion in implements to 154 countries. We are a very diverse industry but our exports to the U.S. make up around 77 or 78 per cent. So there’s no doubt that is the first market manufacturers will dip their toe in. But at the same time we encourage Canada to pursue trade agreements, to pursue a free trade agreement with China. Australia is still a good market for our industry. In Kazakhstan, there’s strong demand there for our products. So diversity is going to be important for our industry.\\n\\nAMC has been working with the U.S.-based AEM to lobby for a return to normal trade, is there optimism that message will be heard in the right circles in the U.S.?\\n\\nI think the key message is we’ll control what we can, but those things we can’t we’re not going to speculate on. So from that perspective, when we encourage the Canadian government to get back to the table, the real message is all this craziness over tariffs is causing uncertainty. So we’re not sure where, when and how to invest, when, where and how to employ more people. So the sentiment is there’s concern. But if it’s going to continue, it’s going to continue and we’ll operate our businesses accordingly. And I think the repercussions on the farm industry in both Canada and the U.S. was quite underestimated. This will hit our farming industry very heavily if it proceeds.',\n",

       "     'text': 'This year, Ford, GM and FCA’s Ram brand marketing staff had a lot to talk about at the major auto shows. All three have given their pickup truck lines some serious overhauls, with new engines and a wider range of materials in their bodies and chassis, plus new drivetrain configurations all working their way into next year’s models.\\n\\nBetter fuel economy is the driving force behind many of those changes, and the new Ram 1500 is a prime example of that, as the brand’s engineers have worked to reduce their fuel appetites while not losing anything when it comes to performance.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nUnder the hood of a new Ram, buyers can opt for a 3.6-litre Pentastar V-6 or the classic 5.7 Hemi V-8 engines, which are integrated into a “mild hybrid” eTorque drivetrain. That combines a 48-volt battery pack with an engine start-stop function and offers short-term torque assist and brake energy regeneration.\\n\\nEnergy is stored in a 430-watt-hour lithium-ion nickel manganese cobalt (NMC)-graphite battery. The small-suitcase-sized, air-cooled battery pack mounts to the rear wall inside the Ram 1500’s cab.\\n\\nInteractive Deceleration Fuel Shut Off (iDFSO) pauses fuel flow to the engine cylinders when the vehicle is decelerating.\\n\\nThe short-term power boost from the eTorque adds up to 90 pound-feet of torque to the 3.6 litre and 130 to the Hemi. The new generation TorqueFlite eight-speed transmission delivers power more efficiently, according to the company, and gives the vehicle what marketers call a new “more powerful” computer control.\\n\\nThe Ram’s body design also gets a new face at the front end, and the trucks shed 225 pounds compared to previous models, despite being 0.5 inches wider and available with a longer frame and wheelbase. All that is thanks to the use of more aluminum components.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the use of non-traditional materials, however, GM’s Sierra pickups move to the front of the line with their CarbonPro boxes. The interior sidewall and bed floor are made of carbon fibre, which is stronger than an equal amount of steel by weight.\\n\\nThe 2019 Silverados are 450 pounds (204 kilograms) lighter than last year’s models, while the Sierras have shed about 360 pounds (163 kilograms).\\n\\nA notable addition to both the 2019 GM truck lines is the introduction of a 3.0-litre in-line, six-cylinder, turbocharged diesel engine, which means diesel power is now available in both the Silverado and Sierra 1500 Series trucks.\\n\\nThe new 5.3-litre and 6.2-litre V-8 options will get Dynamic Fuel Management, which actively shuts off any number of cylinders, in a variety of combinations, depending on immediate needs to optimize fuel economy. This, says GM, will result in instant power when called for. And although GM has had a cylinder shutoff system on earlier models, the company claims this version of the technology is an industry first.\\n\\nJust like the Rams, the GM trucks grow a bit, with a 3.9-inch (100 millimetre) longer wheelbase and an overall length increase of 1.6 inches (41 millimetres). The cabs get stretched too, offering three additional inches of rear seat legroom.\\n\\nNot to be outdone in the engine department this year, Ford announced it is joining the ranks of automakers offering a diesel engine option in half-ton pickups. The 2018 F150 will be available with a total of six different engine choices, and for the first time that includes a 3.0-litre V-6, turbocharged diesel capable of 30 m.p.g. (7.84 l/100 km).\\n\\nThe 250-horsepower diesel puts out its maximum 440 pound-feet of torque at just 1,750 r.p.m., and it gets mated with its own 10-speed transmission programmed to make optimum gear selections based on that torque specification.\\n\\nThe engine uses a compacted graphite iron block paired with a forged steel crankshaft to reduce weight. There’s also a cast aluminum oil pan that houses a two-stage oil pump that the brand claims helps reduce parasitic power loss inside the engine.\\n\\nAll the 2019 models will begin arriving at dealerships early this fall.',\n",

       "     'text': 'As the warm weather comes on, a job on every farm is to pull the yard care equipment out of storage and get it running again. If that’s getting to be a nuisance, you might want to look at some of the new offerings in the lawn and sub-compact tractor segments that manufacturers have introduced for 2018. Any of them should easily take care of keeping large farmyards tidy and trimmed.\\n\\nJohn Deere made some major changes to its popular line of 100 Series lawn tractors for this spring. The brand claims the changes make these models more comfortable to operate and also easier to maintain.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Our main priority is to provide an easy and hassle-free experience for owners to maintain their lawn tractors,” said Kirk Eisenbeis, product marketing manager for John Deere.\\n\\nAmong the changes to the 100 Series, which gets a new model, the E150, are new dual foot pedals, one for forward travel and the other for reversing. The operator’s station has been modified to better accommodate both tall and short drivers and the cut-height lever has been redesigned to give better leverage when lifting and lowering the mower deck while still keeping out of the way for easy mounting and dismounting. As well, the ReadyStart feature makes choking the engine during normal startup unnecessary.\\n\\nArguably the biggest change, though, is Deere’s new quick oil change feature.\\n\\n“The ability to change oil easily, quickly, and without a mess is really appealing to people who don’t have traditional oil change experience,” said Eisenbeis.\\n\\nThe 100 Series lawn tractors now have a combined filter and oil canister that holds about 0.76 of a litre of oil. Just twist the canister a quarter turn and it comes off with the filter and contaminated oil. Then twist the new one on in the same way, and the job is complete in only 30 seconds or so.\\n\\nThis system even ensures there are no oil spills on the garage floor to clean up afterward.\\n\\nNew Holland also has something to announce that should please those in charge of farmyard maintenance. The brand has two new machines to offer in the sub-compact tractor segment, adding the Workmaster 25 and smaller 25S models to its lineup.\\n\\nThe Workmaster 25 gets a three-cylinder 24.7 horsepower diesel engine mated to either a 12×12 gear transmission or a three-range hydrostat. It is capable of delivering 7.9 g.p.m. (30 l/m) of hydraulic flow to an implement. It also brings a category one three-point hitch that has a lift rating of 1,808 pounds (820 kilograms) at the ball ends, and it has a 540 r.p.m. PTO shaft.\\n\\nThe more compact 25S uses the same three-cylinder diesel and a hydrostatic transmission, but it looks more like a lawn tractor and has lower specifications in almost all categories except horsepower. Available in four different configurations, the 25S can still be fitted with a loader or small backhoe attachment, and it offers a rear PTO and three-point hitch as well.\\n\\nWe should also mention that South Korea’s Kioti tractor brand made changes to its sub-compact tractor line last year, introducing factory-mounted cabs on its 35- and 40-horsepower CK models.\\n\\n“On a lot of the small tractors, you don’t have factory-mounted cabs,” said Gerry Picard, Kioti’s territory manager. “A lot of guys were asking about that. So we have a beautiful system now. We decided to put a factory-mount cab on a 35 and 40 horsepower. It’s our SE version.”\\n\\nThe cabs are typical of what you’d expect on a tractor of any horsepower class. They’re airtight, with plenty of quiet.\\n\\n“It’s done right from the factory and it is a nice piece of work,” Picard adds. “It comes with air conditioning, heat, all that kind of stuff. And it’s very quiet. There aren’t any loose fittings or air holes.”',\n",

Otherwise, the forecast played out pretty close to what the weather models predicted.\\n\\nTo begin this forecast period, the area of high pressure that brought us some relief from the heat will have moved off toward the Great Lakes.

This was then followed by a return to sunshine and warming temperatures that culminated in the really hot and humid weather we experienced last Saturday.

       "     'text': 'Many Western Canadian producers are turning to grain bags either as a backup to bin storage or a logistical solution during the busy harvest season.\\n\\nAccording to Dave Nelson, senior vice-president of sales for Loftness, there are a host of reasons why producers might want to consider grain bagging.\\n\\n“When all of the bins on a farm reach capacity, grain bags offer the ability to add a virtually unlimited amount of storage,” he says. A variety of loading options helps make grain bagging equipment adaptable to any farming operation, he adds, while unloading can be done on producers’ terms after harvest, “when it is more convenient, more labour is available, and trucking rates are more reasonable.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nToday’s loading equipment ensures bags can be filled at rates up to 30,000 bushels per hour, says Nelson, which means there are no interruptions during harvest.\\n\\nBut as with any farm technology, there’s a right way and a wrong way to use it. Here are three tips to keep in mind if you choose to bag grain this harvest.\\n\\nBag dry grain\\n\\nAccording to Joy Agnew, who manages agricultural research services at the Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute (PAMI), grain bags are a great option, and can offer savings in terms of logistics during the busy harvest system.\\n\\n“But they are meant for short term,” she says, “and once the grain is in the bag there’s no opportunity for management.”\\n\\nRecently, some grain bag aeration products have come to market, but Agnew cautions that they haven’t been extensively evaluated and it isn’t known whether producers can get the same level of aeration control in bags as in bins with traditional aeration systems.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThere’s always a risk of spoilage when producers use bags, especially if grain is exposed to temperature and moisture if bags are not sealed correctly.\\n\\n“Grain going into the bags should be cool and dry,” says Agnew.\\n\\nCheck bags regularly\\n\\nAccording to Agnew, another risk of grain bags is that they are exposed to the elements — and to wild animals and birds. Producers should get out and check bags for incisions regularly, and at least weekly in areas with significant wildlife pressure, she says.\\n\\n“Usually it’s not that big, and producers avoid spoilage by mending and covering holes. But if there’s a large enough incision the whole bag has to be switched.\\n\\n“I know one guy who was out there every three days with his kids covering holes last year,” she says.\\n\\nGrain bags have to be managed — they can’t just be left in fields at the mercy of Mother Nature.\\n\\nKnow your recycling options\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nOnce bags are emptied, they can’t be reused. Producers use 15,000 to 20,000 bags annually in Saskatchewan alone. At 150 kg per 250-foot bag, that’s a lot of plastic to deal with.\\n\\nThe government of Saskatchewan officially launched a new grain bag recycling program this March. It’s managed by CleanFarms, which is also running a pilot project in Manitoba.\\n\\nBarry Friesen, general manager at CleanFarms, says grain bags can be a headache for producers once they’re emptied. “It’s a massive piece of plastic,” he says. “Farmers have tried everything from landfilling the bags to burning them, but even burning them takes a lot of work.”\\n\\nThe Environmental Handling Fee, or cost of recycling the bags — about $40 — is now included in the up-front cost of grain bags, so producers don’t have to pay anything when they deliver the bags to a depot.\\n\\n“I’ve been in the recycling business for 20 some years so getting these collection rates can take a while, but for something like grain bags, which are large and need to be dealt with almost as soon as they’re emptied, I anticipate 75 per cent plus will be collected in our first year,” Friesen predicts.\\n\\nGrain bag collection businesses are also developing, such as EcoGenX, based in Canora, Sask., which offers bag rolling and pickup services.',\n",

       "     'text': 'In February, Case IH announced it had expanded its 4400 Series line of corn headers with what it calls “all-new” narrow-row configurations. These new 12-,16-, and 18-row models are meant to appeal to growers who use 20- or 22-inch row spacing.\\n\\n“We took a clean-sheet approach to our new narrow row corn headers,” said Case IH’s Kelly Kravig, in a press release. “The new design focuses on five key performance areas to help producers pick cleaner, increase picking speeds, save more grain and pick up down corn.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAlong with those improvements in performance, the new headers weigh in at up to 2,000 pounds lighter than much of their competition, according to the brand. That, notes Kravig, will help improve combine floatation, decrease soil compaction and decrease the odds of getting stuck in wet fields.\\n\\nThe new headers use a redesigned power flow. For the first time, Case IH combines channel drive through centrally-mounted gear boxes in the middle of the header and split torque equally to the right and left sides. From there, separate drive lines power the row units and choppers, providing more efficient power flow and improved protection for the drive lines.\\n\\n“A single drive line is fine if you have 150-bushel corn,” added Kravig. “But when handling loads above 250 bushels, producers need a corn header made for today and the future,”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThere are other changes built into the new 4400 headers as well. They include row guide sensors to help the unit stay centred on the rows. The divider and hood profile have been changed to create a smoother material flow, flip-up tall corn attachments have been integrated into the dividers to help prevent ear loss, and the new headers can more easily accommodate larger stalk diameters.\\n\\nCase IH’s sister brand, New Holland, has released its version of the new corn header, calling it the 9200 CornMaster Series. The new yellow headers share most of the same features as the Case IH versions; and they, too, will be will be available in 12- to 18-row working widths, specifically designed for 20- and 22-inch row spacing.\\n\\n“When we set out to develop a new series of corn heads for New Holland Combines, we asked our customers what was most important for their total operations and not just for the corn heads”, said Dan Valen, Director of Marketing for New Holland, in that brand’s press announcement. “What we heard back was customers really wanted to maximize their combining productivity overall while ensuring every possible kernel of corn ended up in the grain tank and not on the ground. And that’s what we delivered; more total combine productivity, more efficiency, (and) more grain in the bin.”\\n\\nAccording to the company, the 9200 series headers pick cleaner, which means they can reduce the amount of MOG (Material Other than Grain) going into the hopper by up to 28,000 pounds per hour compared to competitive row units attached to a New Holland Combine. And that means the load on the combine engine is reduced by up to 25 horsepower.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Volunteers power many facilities and services in our communities. What motivates people to volunteer and how can non-profit boards engage their volunteer corps?\\n\\nI spoke to two women, from different rural communities in different provinces. Both have experience as board members and in the volunteer corps.\\n\\nBecause I wanted them to speak openly without creating bad blood, I’m withholding their names and other identifying details.\\n\\nWhy do you volunteer?\\n\\n“It’s mostly for the kids,” says Volunteer A. For example, the school council she’s involved with fundraises for things like playground equipment. She has also joined the board of a recreation group to bring more children’s activities into the community. She’s not currently on the recreation organization’s board, but she still volunteers frequently.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nVolunteer B also volunteers with a parent-school organization. She wants her kids to have memories of her being around. She’s also joined a rural hall board. Volunteer B says many of the people involved with that hall are retirement age.\\n\\n“And they deserve a break. And I think it’s time for the people my husband and I’s age to step up and take that from them. Let them just come to the events we plan and enjoy themselves and have us do the work,” says Volunteer B.\\n\\nWhat do you wish board members and other people knew about what you do as a volunteer?\\n\\nVolunteer B wants people to know that she’s not afraid to get involved, and help local organizations evolve. As someone who didn’t grow up in her current community, she brings outside experience and perspective. She wants to stay out of the community politics as much as humanly possible.\\n\\n“I think it’s important to have those people come in without preconceived politics,” says Volunteer B.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhen asked what she wished board members knew about volunteering, Volunteer A had a succinct answer. “Well, it’s not about the glory.” She volunteers to get stuff done.\\n\\nHowever, she has her limits. Sometimes organizers from other communities, which she’s not involved with, ask her to pitch in. In the past she’s said yes, but also made it clear that she won’t do so regularly.\\n\\nThe thing is, the town she’s most active in is “crazy busy” already.\\n\\n“A person can burn out,” says Volunteer A.\\n\\nDo things run smoothly or could the boards do better?\\n\\nWhen she first moved from the city, Volunteer B was on a non-profit board that seemed to tick right along. The executive director linked the board and staff, and many board members volunteered on the front line as well.\\n\\nMore recently, she was at a school meeting where community involvement seemed very low. But she doesn’t think she could speak to how to improve it, other than getting more people involved somehow.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“It’s the struggle that every community deals with. Everybody is just so busy,” says Volunteer B.\\n\\nVolunteer A finds her school council to be very well-run. Everyone chips in, she says, and everyone is in the loop.\\n\\nBut the recreation board doesn’t always support it’s volunteers, says Volunteer A. The board once decided to have a volunteer appreciation event, but had the volunteers organize and work at it. Most of the board members didn’t even show up, says Volunteer A.\\n\\nIn all fairness, it’s not an easy job and board members are volunteering too. This non-profit is managing many activities, with many committees, and Volunteer A thinks that may be part of the problem. Perhaps some committees need to be separate non-profits.\\n\\nShe acknowledges that a board’s main task is to manage the organization. But board members also need to listen to the front-line volunteers, she says. They will have a better idea of what’s working and what’s not.\\n\\n“It’s okay to say: ‘This didn’t work so let’s scrap it.’”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Corn stover harvest is normally an American pastime, but one Manitoba couple says the process can work here and might help fill feed supplies for anyone coming up short going into next winter\\n\\nPasture conditions and a less-than-ideal first cut already have some producers weighing options on feed, but one Manitoba farmer says the answer might lie in the corn stover.\\n\\nAlfred Billingham, along with his wife, Judy, says they’ve filled in their feed supplies with baled corn stover for years, a practice more popular in the longer growing season in the United States.\\n\\n“Sometimes we were rolling up snow and all sorts of things and, in the first year, we weren’t sure whether that was smart or not, but the bales actually fermented from the moisture in them most times and the cows really like that stuff,” he said. “But it’s a slow process. It takes usually a week to do a quarter.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nBillingham turned to an all-crop combine header with choppers to slice corn close to the ground and run the entire plant through the combine. The chopped stalks and leaves would then be immediately picked up by a baler running behind the combine.\\n\\nBale contents were shredded just before feeding and laid down in a feed row to supplement the Billinghams’ other feed.\\n\\nThe producers estimate they got anywhere from two to five bales an acre each year.\\n\\n“The best time to bale it is right after the combine has dropped it,” Judy Billingham said. “You leave it too long, then it gets frost on it and if you don’t have good belts in your baler, the belts will ice up in the ridges and then it slips and you can’t bale anything.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe alternative feed may draw the eye of producers already looking at short supplies this year. Provincial experts have warned that some pastures were already stressed going into the year, after dry conditions last fall caused some farmers to push pasture supplies. Others may be stressed from premature turnout and poor growing conditions this spring. Added to that, producers have reported below-average hay cuts in much of the province.\\n\\nEquipment challenges\\n\\nBillingham says that corn stover was a boon to his cattle operation, but admits that the harvest process was slow, something that might make other producers reluctant to adopt the practice.\\n\\nThe thick stalks and high biomass risked plugging the combine, and most days his speed topped out at two miles an hour.\\n\\n“You’re dealing with huge amounts of product,” he said.\\n\\n“The limiting speed of the combining had a lot to do with the fact that the header would only take the corn so fast, because there’s a lot of power required to chop all of that stover,” he added\\n\\nBillingham’s all-crop header has also largely fallen out of favour with farmers, and most would have to add in the cost of that investment.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nEquipment costs also extended to the baler, the Billinghams said. The couple’s original baler lost a long line of teeth every year from picking stover out of the roughage, although Alfred noted that the problem reduced significantly after the farm added a new baler with different pickups.\\n\\n“It was really hard on the baling, but you ended up with a product that you basically had to fight with otherwise,” he said. “If you don’t clean the cornfield off, you have to go out there with a heavy disc and disc it or some other method to chop that stuff up.”\\n\\nWhat about spoilage?\\n\\nManitoba Agriculture livestock specialist Ray Bittner says stover may be a viable option some years, but he’s cautious about consistently relying on the method.\\n\\nBittner says Manitoba’s shorter growing season and typical fall weather shifts make it less friendly for baled stover, since stalks do not dry properly when corn is harvested in late fall as they might farther south.\\n\\n“What happens is you roll that corn stover together into a bale and those damp stalks will start moulding and they’ll start heating,” he said.\\n\\n“In the past, it’s taken kind of outstanding years of really good maturity in corn to mature in time that it could be combined and baled in fall, dry,” he added. Stover might be an option this year since most corn is ahead of schedule, although that would still depend on favourable weather come fall.\\n\\n“It’s not an always thing,” Bittner cautioned. “And the farther south in the province you go, the more likely it is to happen.”\\n\\nThe Billinghams, in fact, did note heating in their bales, although they maintain that spoilage was minimal as long as all bales were used up before the end while weather stayed cold.\\n\\n“When it was frozen, it was fine,” Judy said. “It looked like just corn leaves when you put it through the shredder… I put it out and that was their treat for the day besides grain.”\\n\\nSpoilage began to be an issue when warm weather hit in February and March, she added.\\n\\n“If the bale wasn’t that good or I didn’t think it was that good, I’d just take off the wrapping around it and leave it out there and they would pick through, take the best and leave the rest, but I didn’t have many mould issues because I made sure I fed it before the sun gets hot.”\\n\\nThe couple says they never noticed any concern with aborted calves or other animal health issues from the feed.\\n\\nAccording to a 2013 resource put out by the Iowa Corn Board, producers who harvest stover should avoid moisture over 20 per cent or avoid spoilage.\\n\\nThe same resource suggests farmers should keep stover bales in a barn or shelter or stacked in the field and covered with a tarp, compared to Billingham’s method, which left bales unstacked and in the field.\\n\\nBittner suggests that farmers short on feed might consider corn silage rather than take a gamble on stover, despite requiring a producer to give up on a corn grain crop.\\n\\n“We know 100 per cent, for sure, that if you get a forage harvest and then cover the pile correctly, you’ve got maximum feed value, maximum usage of that field that grew. Whereas if you combine it and then take a chance on the stover, you could get some or you could get next to none.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Some readers may remember the Western Grain Stabilization Administration (WGSA), a Prairie grain support program that ran from 1976 to 1989. Farmers could contribute up two per cent of net grain sales, matched two to one by the federal government. It was a pretty good deal, so most farmers participated.\\n\\nThe payout mechanism was simple — probably too simple. Money would be triggered when Prairie grain income fell below a running five-year average. It was possible that farmers in one area could have a drought and not get a payout because farmers in other areas had a bumper. Conversely, farmers with good crops might get a payment they didn’t need.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe WGSA proved inadequate to handle the combination of drought and a grain price war during the 1980s, so it was replaced by ad hoc payments and a series of different programs with four-letter acronyms.\\n\\nThe WGSA was cheap and easy to run with a small but dedicated and helpful staff. Hundreds of farmers with questions about their account were on a first-name basis with Omar Bilokury, the genial guy with all the answers, who passed away recently.\\n\\nThe other reason it was easy to run was that it worked in tandem with the wheat board permit book system — all board and non-board deliveries to licensed facilities had to be recorded. Most farmers wanted to be in the program, so if other facilities such as feed mills wanted their grain, they needed to submit sales to WGSA. As a result, there was public information on the overall prices farmers received.\\n\\nToday we don’t have that. That’s in contrast to the U.S., where USDA publishes a monthly list of actual prices received by farmers for products ranging from fruits and vegetables through nuts, livestock, grains and hay.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nBuyers report these prices to the USDA. For example, the most recent report says that in May, farmers in North Dakota received US$5.75 per bushel for spring wheat, $4.41 for malting barley, $3.35 for feed barley and $9.25 for canola. The USDA does withhold some information to ensure commercial confidentiality — for example if there is only one sunflower buyer in a state the source is obvious — but most is available.\\n\\nIt’s been six years since the end of the wheat board, which was supposed to mean that we’d have an open market like the one in the U.S., where the USDA also publishes export prices and other information such as vessels waiting in port.\\n\\nCanadian farmers are still waiting for similar information. The last Conservative government did finance the Alberta Wheat Commission’s PDQ system, which reports regional cash prices for wheat, canola and peas, based on reports from the elevator companies.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHowever, for wheat they use a voodoo system of subtracting their Canadian dollar cash price minus the U.S. futures in U.S. dollars — which is a positive number — and calling that the basis. Last week the companies were telling you they were paying $40 more than the Minneapolis futures. It’s hard to imagine that any farmers pay attention to this. (The weekly cash price report on our markets page converts the currencies to provide a more realistic figure.)\\n\\nOne way or another, these prices are just quotes, not what the companies actually pay. The real basis is the difference between the price on the driveway and the export price at ports, which only the exporters know, but they’re not telling. It would be unreasonable to require them to disclose individual sale prices, but they could report prices in such a way as to provide a realistic average.\\n\\nThere’s no technical reason why in Canada we can’t have the same information as in the U.S. We had it during WGSA, which was not quite pre-computers, but it was when they were as big as shipping containers and sales in small truckloads had to be reported from 3,000-plus elevators, not the 300 or so we have today.\\n\\nAs for export grain prices, AAFC already has market analysis staff who would be happy to collect them if they were given the authority.\\n\\nIf we could do it in the 1970s, we could do it now.

       "     'text': 'Blackleg is an acute, febrile, highly fatal disease of cattle, sheep and goats caused by Clostridium chauvoei characterized by swellings with pockets of trapped air that produce crepitation (crackling) over affected areas. Although blackleg can affect any muscle in the body, including the heart and diaphragm, heavy muscles of the front and hind limbs are most commonly involved. Spores of C. chauvoei exist in the intestinal tract of animals and are widely distributed wherever cattle have been pastured and housed. It’s safest to assume that spores exist everywhere. Spores are extremely resistant and persist in the environment for very long periods of time. Spring is an opportune time for producers to eliminate risk by vaccinating calves before being turned out to pasture.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nBlackleg can be associated with drought. Cattle when grazing ingest C. chauvoei, a soilborne pathogen. As they graze on shorter and shorter forage the risk of ingesting spores increases. Anything that disturbs the soil (flooding, excavation) can also precipitate infections.\\n\\nWhile blackleg is an infectious disease, it is not considered contagious in that cattle with infection will not directly transmit the disease to other cattle. Ingested C. chauvoei spores enter the bloodstream and are deposited in muscle tissue throughout the animal’s body. Spores lie dormant in the muscle tissue until stimulated to sporulate and cause disease. They are activated in low-oxygen environments, like those created in damaged or bruised tissue. Any activity that causes bruising promotes the disease. Once this stimulating event occurs (transport, handling, injection sites, rough/rigorous pasture activity), spores germinate to produce disease-causing bacteria that quickly multiply. The real killer becomes a highly potent toxin produced by replicating bacteria.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAlthough blackleg has occurred in calves as young as two months, the disease generally affects animals between six months and two years. Blackleg typically occurs in beef breeds, in excellent health, and prime condition. The pattern of mortality in an outbreak is generally a few deaths each day, over several days. Most cases are seen in cattle from six to 24 months old, but thrifty calves as young as six weeks and cattle as old as 12 years can be affected. The disease usually occurs in summer and fall and is uncommon in winter. In sheep, blackleg is almost always the result of wound infections (shearing injuries, tail docking, crutching, castration).\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe onset of blackleg is sudden. In the beginning, a few cattle are found dead without any previous signs — eating and normal in the morning, dead by evening. Acute, severe lameness and marked depression are common. There may be a fever initially, but by the time clinical signs are observed, body temperature falls to normal or subnormal. Characteristic fluid-filled, crackling swellings develop over the hip, shoulder, chest, back, neck, or elsewhere. At first, swellings are small, hot, and painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling enlarges, become crepitant, and the skin becomes cold and insensitive as blood supply to affected areas shuts down. Animals become very depressed, may exhibit tremors and ultimately become prostrate. Death occurs within 12 to 48 hours. In some cattle, lesions are restricted to heart muscle and diaphragm so no external signs are evident.\\n\\nSome calves may recover if treated very early with high doses of an antibiotic, like penicillin. However, since blackleg progresses so rapidly, most affected animals fail to respond to treatment; those that do are often too debilitated to recover. In short, treatment is rarely successful. Carcasses should be destroyed by burning or buried deeply in a fenced-off area to limit heavy spore contamination of the soil.\\n\\nSuccess comes with ensuring that cattle are vaccinated against blackleg and the other major clostridial diseases that might occur in a particular area. Veterinarians can advise clients on the prevalence of other clostridial diseases and the necessity to include them in vaccine protocols. While it is not possible to prevent clostridial spores from being present in soil, affordable, high-quality vaccines will prevent the occurrence of blackleg.\\n\\nVaccination safeguards and rules regarding blackleg vaccine:\\n\\nUsers of agricultural and veterinary pharmaceuticals must always read labels and strictly comply with label directions and conditions of use.\\n\\nCold chain safeguards, personal safety and sound biosecurity practices need to be followed with all vaccines.\\n\\nCalves require two doses of blackleg vaccine, ideally one month apart, but at least in the spring and at weaning. It is desirable to give the initial two doses of vaccine before young cattle reach their most susceptible age of six months. First-calf heifers should receive a third vaccination for blackleg the following spring to provide the best protection. The third vaccination should provide lifelong immunity to blackleg.\\n\\nTo await the occurrence of blackleg before vaccinating is unwise, as vaccines take 10 to14 days before they begin to provide immunity.\\n\\nIt is wise to vaccinate all newly bought young cattle.\\n\\nThe vaccine should be delivered just under the skin — not into the muscle. Draw up a pinch of skin and insert the needle between the skin and the muscle. The loose skin of the neck is convenient for this.\\n\\nDo not save unused parts of bottles or containers of vaccines for future use, as they can become contaminated with undesirable organisms and/or lose their potency. Destroy any vaccine not used within 24 hours of opening.\\n\\nIf in doubt about the cause of deaths in cattle, consult your veterinary practitioner.\\n\\nRemember: Blackleg is almost entirely preventable by vaccination.\\n\\nDr. Ron Clarke is a consulting veterinarian living in Alberta.',\n",

       "     'text': 'One of the most undermanaged crops we have in North America is pasture. The reason we don’t manage it or don’t understand it is because most pasture is not bought or sold. It is usually consumed on farm. So we don’t understand the value of it. If we never see any value in it, we don’t expect anything from it. All we need to do is take the time to calculate out a margin on pasture and we can start to understand its value. Do you know what your pastures yield? Do you know the dollars per acre return?\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nI have had many producers over the years tell me that they would never send their cattle to a custom grazier because it is just too expensive. More often than not, I prove to them that it would actually be cheaper for them to send their cattle elsewhere to graze.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\nA producer was at my school and remarked that $1.25/pair/day was really expensive, so I asked him a few questions about his pasture at home. What was the rental value of his land, if he could rent it out? Answer: $3,500. How many cows graze on it? 30 pair. How many days do they normally graze? 100 days. $3,500/(30 x 100)= $1.17/pair/day. Is it cheaper? $1.25 isn’t cheaper than $1.17 but who does all the work for 8.3 cents?\\n\\nCan he get the fence checked in the spring, deal with water and mineral all season long, move, check and treat any animals that might need treating? In this example, including his labour and equipment costs of managing the herd for an entire season, there is no way he is managing the herd cheaper. Trucking costs need to be factored in as well.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nNow don’t take this one example as the only situation possible; in some cases it may very well be a better option to graze your own land. The point I’m making is that we need to look at the real numbers in order to figure out the best options for our situation. To do that we need to calculate the yield off of a pasture.\\n\\nFortunately, there is a tool that can help us do that. A grazing chart is a complicated-looking spread sheet that is really easy to use once you understand how to fill it in. It allows you to figure out what each paddock produced in animal days per acre (ADAs) and then translates that into the universal language of dollars per acre.\\n\\nADA is a measure of how much forage is consumed from each pasture. If you can figure out bushels, then ADAs will be a piece of cake.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe animal value needs to be adjusted depending on the class and the amount of size of livestock that we are grazing. We record the ADA value of the herd and the amount of time that the herd spends in each paddock. We can then add up each area and determine our overall yield in ADAs and dollars per acre.\\n\\nIf you use another unit of measurement such as stock days per acre (SDA) or animal unit days (AUD), that’s fine, just make sure you use the same measurements each year. And it might be difficult to compare your numbers to someone else’s if they don’t use the same units. I have used ADAs for years so that is what I continue to use.\\n\\nFor my grazing chart, my base AD is a 700-lb. yearling. They are valued at 1.0 AD. If they are a bit smaller at 500 lbs. then it’s 0.75 AD. If they are a bit bigger at 900 lbs., 1.25 AD. A dry cow that weighs 1,200 lbs. would be 1.5 AD. A 1,200-lb. cow with a small calf at her side would be 1.75 AD. Let’s say that calf is about 300 lbs., that pair would be 2.0 AD, and if the calf was over 500 lbs., the pair would be 2.25 AD. These are my base numbers. If the cows are heavier or lighter, I would adjust accordingly.\\n\\nWhat is the bull worth? How big is he and is he busy breeding or just grazing in a field? You can use your own judgment from here. I was always told a goat or a sheep would eat 1/8 of what a cow does so that would make them about 0.19 AD. (Or 0.2 would be close enough for me.)\\n\\nIt is really quite simple.\\n\\nOne 700-lb. yearling grazing for 100 days would be 100 AD. Or, if we had 100 yearlings that each weighed 700 lbs. grazing for one day, we would have 100 AD. Or, if we had 50 pairs with the calves averaging 300 lbs. (2.0 AD) grazing for one day, we would have 100 AD. We just adjust the value to get an estimated amount of forage consumed for the day. A cow-calf pair that is valued at 2.0 AD will eat approximately the same amount of forage as two 700-lb. yearlings. Clear as mud?\\n\\nSo what does this grazing chart do? It can help you plan a grazing rotation. Each paddock is listed and shows the dates that each paddock is grazed. You can estimate when and where you will move the herd and try to plan out your graze periods and rest periods. It can also track precipitation throughout the year. This is important when looking back as precipitation can affect yield a great deal throughout your grazing season. We also take into consideration how heavily the paddock was grazed. Some years, depending on precipitation, I might leave more or less residue. The chart can record this.\\n\\nWhen the grazing season is complete, we add up all of the ADAs for each paddock. We can then convert that into dollars per acre, which is the universal language for farmers. This helps us see the difference in production between different paddocks.\\n\\nIs a white clover/fescue pasture better or worse than an alfalfa/brome paddock? If you were to start keeping track of the ADAs you will know. This is valuable information, as it can help us predict what potential new land might produce and can help use determine what rent we can afford to pay. If we want to determine a margin, we better know the yield.\\n\\nThere are charts that you fill in by hand or computerized versions. You just need to look for one.\\n\\nWould you ever take off a crop of wheat without knowing the yield? I think not, yet farmers continually take off a crop of pasture without this important information. Don’t be “that farmer”! Manage your pasture with intensive cell grazing and use a grazing chart. Your bottom line will love it.\\n\\nSteve Kenyon runs Greener Pastures Ranching Ltd. in Busby, Alta. Contact them at 780-307-6500 or by email or find them on Facebook.',\n",

       "     'text': 'In my April column I focused on the principles of protein nutrition in beef cattle with an emphasis on rumen degradable and undegradable protein and on meeting the metabolizable protein needs of the animal. The reason that I focused on this topic was my experiences this past winter with producers who were having difficulty meeting the protein requirements of backgrounding calves, particularly those who fed corn silage as a roughage source. With this article I would like to explore the protein value of common feedstuffs and perhaps point you in the direction of some viable options for this fall.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nFirst let’s compare corn versus barley whether fed as silage or grain. Corn typically averages seven to nine per cent crude protein (CP) on a dry matter (DM) basis, regardless of the form fed. As a forage source, corn silage usually provides adequate protein levels for pregnant beef cows, however, for backgrounding calves and finishing programs, diets formulated with significant levels of corn silage will be short on protein. The same holds true for diets formulated with corn grain. Relative to corn, barley grain and silage have higher levels of CP, typically ranging from 11 to 13 per cent on a DM basis. Protein from both corn and barley silage is relatively soluble in nature and thus is readily degradable in the rumen. Poor silage preservation techniques can, however, lead to heat-damaged protein which is poorly digested. It is also important to remember that while corn grain has a lower level of CP, it also has a higher rumen undegradable protein content than barley grain. This is particularly important in finishing programs. Not only will such programs be short on protein, but they may also be short on rumen degradable protein, a situation I will address below.\\n\\nLegume silage (i.e. alfalfa or sweet clover) while harder to ensile, is typically superior to cereal silages in terms of CP content, averaging 16 to 18 per cent CP. Legume silage is also high in soluble protein which means that it is extensively degraded in the rumen. For backgrounding operations, alfalfa silage is an excellent protein source. In some cases, feedlot operators will layer alfalfa with their corn or barley, which helps with the ensiling of the legume and increases the overall crude protein content of the cereal silage.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nSimilar to silage, the protein content of typical hays will vary with forage type. Legume hay (16 to 18 per cent CP) will be higher in CP than grass hays (nine to 11 per cent), with grass/legume mixtures intermediate. It should be emphasized that these are typical values. Actual values will vary depending on a number of factors with the most important being the stage of maturity at cutting. For example, alfalfa hay cut at 10 per cent bloom might average 18 per cent CP while at full bloom, the protein content could drop to 14 per cent or less.\\n\\nA number of producers rely on a variety of byproduct feeds to meet protein needs. Lentil or pea screenings are good examples. Averaging 18 to 20 per cent CP, lentil screenings work well in both backgrounding and wintering cow diets, particularly considering that their energy content is similar to that of a light oat. Grain screening pellets, depending on their formulation, are an intermediate source of both energy and protein, averaging 13 to 15 per cent CP. As has been discussed previously in this column, wheat or corn distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) at 40 and 30 per cent CP, respectively, also fall into this category. Not only are they excellent sources of CP, but they also supply rumen undegradable protein. Depending on cost, it is not uncommon to see corn or wheat DDGS in finishing diets at levels ranging from 10 to 15 per cent or higher. At levels greater than 10 per cent of the DM, DDGS are not only supplying protein, but are also used as an energy source.\\n\\nOne can also encounter a variety of opportunity feeds that as long as they are processed properly (i.e. cracked or rolled) can serve as excellent protein sources. Examples include cull or heat-damaged faba, pinto and kidney beans which will average 20 to 22 per cent CP. Off-grade canola seed or soybeans can also be fed to beef cattle. While excellent protein sources, one needs to keep in mind that they also supply a significant level of fat which can have an adverse effect on feed intake. In such situations, dietary fat levels should be kept below five to six per cent (DM basis). Both oilseeds need to be processed for effective utilization, particularly off-grade canola seed.\\n\\nFinally let me come back to the scenario where one is feeding high levels of corn grain, perhaps in combination with corn silage. In such a situation, you not only need to balance the ration for CP, but you also need to supply a source of rumen degradable protein to ensure optimal rumen function. In this case, a commercial protein supplement that has a combination of natural protein and urea would be an excellent choice. An example would be a 32(20) supplement which has 32 per cent CP with 20 per cent of the CP coming from non-protein nitrogen (i.e. urea).\\n\\nIn summary, there are a lot of options available to meet the protein needs of your cattle; the key is to plan ahead.',\n",

It includes soil monitors, digital weather stations, wireless grain bin sensors, multispectral imaging, precision ag tools, drones, management software, data analytics, and artificial intelligence — all linked over a Wi-Fi network.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhen complete, the smart farm will top out at more than 1,000 acres and include a livestock operation. In both, students will have a chance to use next-generation technologies that will become more commonplace over the next three to five years.\\n\\n“It’s about establishing practical skills for today, but it’s also about establishing skills and capabilities for them to evolve with the industry as it grows,” said Cullum.\\n\\nHands-on learning\\n\\nThat’s always been the cornerstone of the college’s approach to learning, said former student Nikki Szakaly.\\n\\n“As a student at Olds College, it was the hands-on opportunities that we were provided with to put our knowledge to use that created such an excellent learning environment,” said Szakaly, who now works as an Agri-Trend coach.\\n\\n“The skills and knowledge that I received through my education at Olds College has set me up for a very successful career.”\\n\\nTechnology is allowing producers to make better business decisions on their farms, and that’s only going to continue, said Szakaly.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Bringing the farm into the digital age is revolutionizing the day-to-day operations for multiple generations,” she said.\\n\\nThat will be even more important as the industry grows, said Cullum. It’s estimated there are nearly 60,000 agriculture industry jobs that are unfilled across the country today. But rising enrolment in post-secondary agriculture programs shows there is growing interest in ag careers.\\n\\n“Young people and even people who are looking to make transitions from other industries are seeing agriculture as a place to forge a career. That’s really exciting,” said Cullum.\\n\\n“You don’t have to be an actual producer to have an exciting career in agriculture.”\\n\\nThere’s a need for companies and industry to have a place where they can partner in developing, testing, scaling, and demonstrating that technology, he added.\\n\\n“We now have the opportunity for Olds College to facilitate engagement around the challenges in the industry that need to be solved in order for our industry to produce more using less,” he said. “This isn’t about just putting technology in a field. It’s about focusing on solving those challenges and problems.”\\n\\nThe driver isn’t just the availability of new technology, but the need to do more with less, said Bradley.\\n\\n“If we don’t learn how to do that — and if we don’t teach our students how to do that — we’re not meeting the big-picture needs of the industry.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Pearl Gregor was on the phone the instant she read about ALUS Canada in her county newspaper.\\n\\n“When I heard about ALUS, it was automatic — I had to do it,” said the New Sarepta-area cattle farmer.\\n\\n“We’ve lost so much of the Alberta wetlands. As farmers, we need water, so we need ALUS.”\\n\\nALUS (short for Alternative Land Use Services and pronounced ‘Alice’) compensates farmers and ranchers for providing ecosystem services on their land by contributing to up-front project costs and small annual payments. Common projects include improving riparian areas, maintaining native grasslands, and establishing wildlife habitats.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIn Gregor’s case, it meant fencing off her wetlands and providing an alternative watering source for her small herd.\\n\\n“People talk about the environment, but they very seldom do anything,” said Gregor, who manages her 240-acre farm with help from her son.\\n\\n“ALUS means I’ve got a little bit of wetland, and anyone else who joins might have a little bit of wetland. It just makes sense.”\\n\\nAfter launching in 2006 in Manitoba, ALUS came to Alberta in 2010 through a pilot project in the County of Vermilion River, before spreading to Parkland County in 2012 and Red Deer County in 2013. Today, there are 11 counties in Alberta that support ALUS programs, including the counties of Wetaskiwin and Leduc, where Gregor farms.\\n\\nGregor’s wetlands fencing was the first ALUS project completed in the region. Today, more than 300 acres are enrolled in the area.\\n\\n“It’s a win-win program,” said Kim Barkwell, sustainable agriculture program manager for the County of Wetaskiwin and Leduc County.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Greater society benefits from nature on the landscape, and most producers have some marginal areas on their land that they could enhance. It’s a program that just benefits everyone.”\\n\\nIn many cases, farmers already have some ecosystem services on their land and don’t realize it, said Barkwell. ALUS is a way to recognize the work that’s already being done, while also encouraging additional enhancements to the land.\\n\\n“ALUS is an excellent solution provider,” said Barkwell. “It’s a way to have both nature and productivity on your farm and get rewarded for it.”\\n\\nBig-picture thinking\\n\\nOn Gregor’s farm, the wetlands have already started to rebound in the two years since the fence was installed. Willows are growing again, water levels are up, wildflowers have spread, and ducks are back in their natural habitat.\\n\\n“You can already tell the difference it’s made in allowing the vegetation to come back,” said Barkwell. “It doesn’t take long for nature to do its thing.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nGregor drew on additional government funding to complete the project, Barkwell added. A Growing Forward 2 grant covered 70 per cent of the cost of the fencing, with the remaining 30 per cent being split between Gregor and ALUS. Gregor also receives a yearly per-acre payment for maintaining the wetlands (about $90 in her case).\\n\\nTypically, though, project participants aren’t motivated by the annual payment, said Barkwell.\\n\\n“It’s not about the money,” she said. “Our producers are appreciative of that cheque, but it’s not the only driver.”\\n\\nFor Gregor, the annual payment is a nice bonus, but she has a better reason for preserving her wetlands — water management.\\n\\n“If you want to maximize production on your land, you’re going to need water,” said Gregor.\\n\\n“Farmers need water. We have a vested interest in having a wetland that holds more moisture.”\\n\\nAs Gregor watches the ecosystem on her farm rebuild itself, she sees more and more the value in turning her marginal lands toward a different type of production.\\n\\n“My 3.5 acres haven’t been taken out of production. That 3.5 acres are in production to support the environment,” she said.\\n\\n“The wetlands are in the environment for a reason. The fact that we’ve paved over 80 per cent of them does not bode well for our future.\\n\\n“What will be left of this province in 100 years if we don’t take care of them?”\\n\\nThis project may seem like a drop in the bucket, but every little bit helps, she added.\\n\\n“My project is 3.5 acres, which is minuscule, but I’ve only got 240 acres of land,” said Gregor.\\n\\n“If everybody did one per cent of their own land, it would be quite a bit in the long run.\\n\\n“We’ve got to think of the big picture. I’m just doing what I can.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Grading factors for mildew and heat/frost stress when grading western Canadian wheat will be tweaked starting Aug. 1, the start of the 2018-19 crop year, the Canadian Grain Commission has announced.\\n\\n“It’s not a significant difference,” said Daryl Beswitherick, the grain commission’s program manager for quality assurance standards and reinspection. “The frequency of the factors is a little bit higher in the standards that were approved for use now, but it’s not half a grade difference or anything like that.\\n\\n“So will producers see a big impact? Not likely but there’s a difference there for sure.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe change will see individual standard samples for frost/heat stress and mildew replace the current combined standard samples as the assessment tools for these grading factors in all classes of western Canadian wheat.\\n\\nUnder the previous guidelines, if both factors were present in a delivery, they were jointly assessed using the combined standard samples.\\n\\nNew grain commission research shows these grading factors do not have a compounding negative effect on the end-use functionality of the wheat.\\n\\nIndividual assessment of these grading factors will prevent unnecessary downgrading of wheat while maintaining the high standards of functional quality that customers of Canadian wheat have come to expect.\\n\\n“This will allow the frequency of the grading factor to be a little bit higher than what it was in the standard and therefore more grain will be put into the highest grade possible,” Beswitherick said.\\n\\nThe changes were recommended by the Western Standards Committee, which represents stakeholders from across the grain value chain, the grain commission said in a news release.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIt’s part of the agency’s ongoing initiative to modernize Canada’s grain grading system ensuring grain is graded using the most effective, precise and user-friendly tools possible. That includes, where practical, using instruments in wheat grading — something some farm groups have long been asking for.\\n\\nThere are no instruments on the horizon for measuring heat/frost stress or mildew on the elevator driveway, Beswitherick said, but the commission is investigating the pros and cons of instrument testing for falling number and the mycotoxin DON (deoxynivalenol), sometimes produced by fusarium head blight.\\n\\nWhile heat/frost stress (both have a similar effect on end-use functionality) and mildew are subjective grading factors in that there’s no set tolerance based on a percentage of damaged kernels, the effect on functionality has been determined scientifically and the standard samples used by commission and grain company inspectors provides grading consistency, Beswitherick said.\\n\\n“The techniques that we train our staffs to, and how to assess it, really lends to a lot of consistency,” he said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Over the years it has worked… well in the efficiency of handling grain through the handling system and repeatable results from a producer unloading a truck, through loading rail cars, to loading a vessel… Until technology can provide us with another option we will continue to assess frost and mildew this way.”\\n\\nSeveral years ago the commission increased the tolerance for mildew after tests revealed a reduced impact on functionality, Beswitherick said. It hasn’t nailed down what caused the change. One hypothesis is it relates to the shift away from swathing to more straight combining. The kernels of standing wheat presumably dry faster than those on the ground.\\n\\n“The mildew that we’re seeing is not impacting the end-use functionality or flour colour like it once did,” he said.',\n",

       "     'text': 'BEIJING, July 20 (Reuters) - In the tense trade war with the United States, China\\'s government has turned to an unlikely weapon: a cartoon bean.\\n\\n\"Hi, everybody. I am a soybean. I may not look like much, but I\\'m very important,\" says the animated character in a video posted on Friday on the website of China Global Television Network (CGTN), the overseas news network of state-owned China Central Television.\\n\\nThe short video in English with Chinese subtitles seems designed to undermine support for the trade dispute from U.S. farmers, key supporters of President Donald Trump, by highlighting the damage tariffs could have on American soybean exports.\\n\\nIts release follows the imposition on July 6 of tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports by the United States. In return, China levied taxes on the same value of products from the United States, including soybeans. Trump has also threatened further tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.\\n\\nThe video also highlights efforts by China\\'s Communist Party to turn to foreign actors, cartoons and even rap to try to deliver its ideas in less turgid formats.\\n\\nOpting for the unusual narrator illustrates how Beijing views soybeans as a powerful tool in its battle with its top trading partner. Soybeans were the United States\\' biggest agricultural export to China, worth $12 billion last year.\\n\\nThe video is partly educational, but is mostly aimed at delivering a political message.\\n\\nAfter outlining the main uses of soybeans from tofu to animal feed to biscuits, the bean turns its focus to its central role in the trade war.\\n\\nChina can choose to buy beans from other exporters, such as Argentina and Brazil, if prices become too expensive, the bean says in the video.\\n\\nBut falling prices and lower sales would hurt U.S. soybean farmers, it warns, pointing out that U.S. prices have fallen by 18 percent from May to early July, to their lowest this year.\\n\\nNine out of the top ten soybean growing states voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, the video notes.\\n\\n\"So will voters there turn out to support Trump and the Republicans once they get hit in the pocketbooks?\" asks the bean.\\n\\nThe cartoon does not mention that soymeal prices in China are rising, triggering fears of food inflation. Soymeal is a crucial animal feed ingredient for pork producers and the country is the world\\'s biggest pork consumer.\\n\\nIt is not the first time soybeans have had a starring role in Beijing\\'s trade showdown with Washington. Social media was transfixed by a ship racing to deliver its cargo of U.S. beans before the tariffs kicked in.\\n\\nFor a link to the video, click on: https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d414e7a45544f78457a6333566d54/share_p.html\\n\\n(Reporting by Josephine Mason; Additional reporting by John Ruwitch in SHANGHAI; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)\\n\\n© Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018.

       "     'text': 'By Michael Hirtzer and Tom Polansek\\n\\nCHICAGO, July 20 (Reuters) - Chinese importers of the livestock feed sorghum feasted on tabbouleh salad and chipotle tortillas made with the U.S. grain at a Texas barbecue this week, as farmers try to woo buyers in the middle of an escalating U.S.-China trade war.\\n\\nDespite the overtures to the world\\'s top sorghum buyer, no deals were struck over the meal, held at the home of the head of the Texas Sorghum Producers. The normally brisk sorghum trade between the two countries has ground to a halt as tensions mount between Washington and Beijing.\\n\\nChinese buyers, who normally buy 90 percent of their sorghum imports from the United States, stopped purchasing due to concerns a tariff would be imposed and drive up the cost of shipments. On July 6, that fear became reality when Beijing included sorghum in a list of U.S. exports to face levies in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.\\n\\nIn rural Texas, the executive director of the producer group, Wayne Cleveland, hosted the Chinese delegation for a beef brisket barbecue at his home.\\n\\nAlso on the menu were tortillas made from sorghum - rather than wheat or corn - and duck, which is fed sorghum in China. In addition to its use as an animal feed, sorghum can form the base of gluten-free foods. In China it is used to make a fiery liquor called baijiu.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at the meal, part of a trip organized before Beijing implemented tariffs, was friendly as buyers enjoyed a view of the starry night, Cleveland said.\\n\\nBut there was little talk of the politics that has disrupted trade between the two sides, he said.\\n\\nThe loss of Chinese buying has pushed sorghum prices lower and hurt farmers in Texas. Sorghum is widely grown because it is a hardy crop that can withstand the hot climate.\\n\\n\"We need that market back,\" Cleveland told Reuters.\\n\\nFlorentino Lopez, executive director of the United Sorghum Checkoff, an industry group, said Chinese buyers who attended the dinner were concerned about the longer-term impact of the trade war. They wanted to know if U.S. farmers may cut back on sorghum plantings, which could tighten supplies available for sale next year even if Washington and Beijing resolve their differences.\\n\\n\"They are looking forward and being prepared for when they can actually make some purchases,\" Lopez said.\\n\\nSorghum was one of the first casualties of the U.S.-China trade war. China launched an anti-dumping probe into sorghum in February in response to U.S. tariffs on solar panels and washing machines.\\n\\nChinese buyers have bought no significant volumes since then, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In 2017, they bought about $839 million of U.S. sorghum, most of which was shipped in the months after the autumn harvest.\\n\\nBoth sides were frustrated by the impasse.\\n\\n\"I want to sell and they want to buy,\" one trader said.\\n\\nA Chinese sorghum buyer not participating in the trip told Reuters that buying would restart if U.S. prices fall lower.\\n\\n\"We will definitely buy when prices are at a reasonable level, even with the 25 percent tariff,\" the buyer said.\\n\\nHIGH AND DRY\\n\\nColin Chopelas, who farms near the Texas port of Corpus Christi, finished harvesting his sorghum fields three weeks ago. His crop is in a grain elevator awaiting buyers.\\n\\nDemand has taken a further hit because Mexico, another big market for U.S. sorghum, has been canceling sales, USDA data showed on Thursday. An abundance of other available feeds, especially U.S. corn, was also limiting interest in sorghum.\\n\\n\"Mexico is always an option, but they are not going to pay what we would typically get going to China,\" Chopelas said. That has pushed down prices.\\n\\nAn elevator operated by global grains merchant Archer Daniels Midland at Corpus Christi was bidding roughly $3.68 per bushel to buy sorghum. Earlier this year, sorghum there fetched as much as $4.80 per bushel, according to Reuters data.\\n\\nThe Chinese delegation, which Sorghum Checkoff said represents importers that account for more than half of China\\'s total sorghum imports from the United States, will travel to Kansas next week. ADM and Gavilon, a unit of Marubeni Corp , said they are participating in the trade mission.\\n\\nCargill Inc will also attend, participants and other sorghum traders said. Cargill had no comment.\\n\\nADM said in May it would take a $30 million hit to its second-quarter trading profit related to disrupted sorghum shipments.\\n\\nAt a tour of an Attebury Grain facility in Saginaw, Texas, the Chinese importers said they still want to buy U.S. sorghum but are worried about the tariff making deals too expensive, said George Gurganus, a grain buyer for Attebury Grain who met the group.\\n\\nWith China\\'s demand down, Gurganus is searching for alternative markets. \"We\\'re looking at every other outlet we can find,\" he said.\\n\\n(Additional reporting by Hallie Gu in Beijing; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Leslie Adler)\\n\\n© Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018.

       "     'text': '“Have you ever read the book, Hollowing Out the Middle?” asks Paula Jensen in a tidy office just off the spacious Main Street of Langford, South Dakota.\\n\\nThe 2009 book details the reasons young people leave rural areas. Often, it’s the community’s adults who encourage it.\\n\\n“Basically, the straight-A students are told to go away and never come back. It’s only the losers who stay, right?” says the Langford native and vice president of advancement with Dakota Resources, a nonprofit community development organization.\\n\\nPaula Jensen “I never felt that way,” says the 1985 graduate of Langford High School. “I always felt like I had a place here if I wanted to come back. My husband had an opportunity to buy an auto repair business, and it just seemed like a natural fit. I always knew that if I had a family, I wanted to raise them near their grandparents and aunts and uncles.”\\n\\nJensen’s not alone. Each spring, she speaks to rural South Dakota high school students and asks how many of them would choose to live in their communities if they could.\\n\\n“I was in Langford a few weeks ago, and 80% of them raised their hands,” she says. “When I go across the state, it’s always more than 50%. In some smaller communities, it’s 98%.”\\n\\nMark Nelson Mark Nelson, a loan officer with Grow South Dakota (a nonprofit economic development group) and a Langford farmer, sees similar responses when he speaks to Langford students.\\n\\n“I find it interesting that the seniors also express their ideas on projects that will affect Langford’s future,” says Nelson, a 2005 Langford Area High School graduate. “Our youth are willing to come back. The future is promising if we can retain them or give them an opportunity to come back.”\\n\\nFarming is Still Key\\n\\nOn a typical day, farm equipment rumbles down Langford’s streets. Farmers grumble about crop prices, and a split-second later, they smile about how great their corn crop looks. Folks drink coffee in The Front Porch café and talk sports and politics.\\n\\nIn short, it’s akin to the thousands of other small towns that dot rural America. (Full disclosure: Langford is my hometown.)\\n\\nMany such towns face a turning point. John Ikerd, a retired University of Missouri agricultural economist, sees the rural mood as “a growing sense of impotence and dread.” Ultimately, a positive rural future hinges on rural residents taking the future into their own hands and working together for their community’s common good, says Ikerd.\\n\\nThis isn’t easy. Through the years, farm consolidation has clipped population, school size, and businesses. Bruce Likness recalls a packed Main Street on Wednesday and Saturday nights in Langford when he was a teenager in the 1950s.\\n\\n“You couldn’t find a parking place on Main Street,” recalls Likness, who, along with his wife, Jean, is a lifelong Langford resident.\\n\\nStill, change happens.\\n\\n“I don’t know how we would have prevented or slowed down the transformation in agriculture,” adds Likness, whose family owned a farm implement dealership at Langford and nearby Britton locations from the 1940s into the 2000s. “You would like to go back, but no one wants to go back to an (International) M tractor or a John Deere 70 tractor. The American psyche of having the biggest and best comes into play.”\\n\\nDavid Planteen Yet, Langford has been, is, and will always be a farming community. David Planteen started farming in the mid-1980s after he graduated from South Dakota State University.\\n\\n“When I got married, our farm was not big enough to support two families,” says the 1979 Langford High School graduate.\\n\\nSo, he started working as a loan officer at the First State Bank in nearby Claremont in 2002 before transferring to the Langford State Bank in 2009. He also sells crop insurance, serves as the school board president of the Langford Area Public School (LAPS), and is starting his 33rd year of officiating high school sports.\\n\\n“My dad had the foresight to say that even if you’re coming back to the farm, get an education,” says Planteen. “He said your farm can be taken away from you, but your education can’t.”\\n\\nSchool is an Anchor\\n\\nBill Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Farm Credit Mid-America, says school consolidation that leaves small towns without their school plays a sad but predictable role. “Other businesses then consolidate, and over time, the size of the community decreases,” he says.\\n\\nLangford faced this dilemma around 20 years ago. Its junior high and high school building – built in 1926 – was falling apart. Langford’s population had steadily eroded from a peak of 510 residents in the 1920 census to a low of 290 citizens in the 2000 census.\\n\\nAfter considerable debate, Langford residents swallowed hard and built a new school building.\\n\\nSkeptics abounded.\\n\\n“I was working at the bank at that time, and I had a lot of people who would come in and say, ‘Your kids are never going to get to graduate from high school in Langford. There won’t be any school here in 20 years,’” says Jensen.\\n\\nFortunately, the population decline stopped. In the 2010 census, the population actually rose a bit to 313. The student population since 2000 has remained steady, bobbing between 188 to 222 for K-12 students. Some high school classes have had only eight students, while others have had 24.\\n\\nGeography helped. “We’re a bridge between three bigger towns: Britton, Groton, and Webster,” says Planteen. Students who prefer a smaller high school often opt for Langford, he says. Langford has also picked up students when smaller area schools closed.\\n\\nLangford’s faculty also helps, says Jensen. “I think the teachers here instill a level of excellence,” says Jensen. She cites Kelly Wieser, the school’s longtime music teacher, as an example.\\n\\n“Just yesterday, a little boy came in here who was raising money to go to music camp,” says Jensen. “She encourages students to do those kinds of things to make themselves better.”\\n\\nAttracting teachers isn’t easy, as South Dakota often ranks at the nation’s bottom for teacher pay. One factor that helps Langford battle this is its school’s reputation.\\n\\n“There is a really strong commitment that the community has to this school,” says Monte Nipp, LAPS superintendent. “We had a teacher retire at the Newport (Hutterite) Colony School (in Langford’s school district), and I was worried about how many applicants we were going to get. Well, we ended up interviewing six. The word is out that people want to teach at Langford.”\\n\\nThis year, 68% of the school district’s voters passed a $3.4 million project for an addition that will include a new music room, a student and community wellness center, a multipurpose gym, a special education facility update, and facility maintenance. This time, few – if any – negative voices spoke at five public meetings regarding the addition.\\n\\n“Instead, it was a message of ‘Let’s make our facilities ready for the future because we want to keep attracting those families and students who want to come to a small school setting,’ ” says Nipp.\\n\\nBuilding Businesses\\n\\n“People once thought we were going to become a buffalo-roaming community because there’d be nothing left,” says Nelson. “I think we have more businesses and investment on Main Street than when I graduated from high school 13 years ago. We embrace our local entrepreneurs.”\\n\\nChad Hardy operates a thriving lumberyard. Stuart and Krissa Samson started County Line Seed in 2012, and they market inputs like seed and precision farming equipment to area farmers. Meanwhile, Jordan Deutsch founded a hunting camouflage business called Fallin’ Fowl Camo.\\n\\nSeveral steps taken in the past 15 years have helped sustain Langford’s businesses, says Jensen. Glacial Lakes Area Development helps support local individuals and industries with tools like business development goals. In 2008, Langford started a foundation that earns $10,000 annually for community project grants. The Front Porch, a 5,000-square-foot facility, opened in 2015. It houses four new businesses, including a restaurant and bar. Funding came in the form of loans from economic development entities, local bank funding, cash donations, and stock purchases from 110 area investors.\\n\\nA daycare spawned from a 2000 state program also supports the community.\\n\\n“I think it said something to the community; namely, we care about families, we care about our kids, and we want to keep people here,” says Jensen.\\n\\nIt’s challenging, though, to maintain traffic for businesses. “It might be packed in The Front Porch for dinner on Mother’s Day,” says Likness. On some nights, though, just a handful of customers are present, he notes.\\n\\nHousing is another hurdle. On the surface, cheap housing sounds great. Dig deeper, though, and these often-dilapidated houses create a transient population.\\n\\n“They are often not community-minded citizens,” says Jensen.\\n\\nNelson says new people and former residents want to move back, but often they have no house to move back to. Meanwhile, someone has to incur the cost of tearing down dilapidated houses to make room for new ones.\\n\\n“I would say the vast majority of South Dakota is not overbuilt, but under-demolished,” says Nelson.\\n\\nThe New Rural\\n\\n“I think the philosophy of the new rural is that we can’t re-create what we grew up with or what our parents or grandparents grew up with,” says Jensen. “We don’t remember those crowded Wednesday and Saturday nights when people would come to shop on a packed Main Street.”\\n\\nOn the plus side, a Langford Area Lions boy’s high school basketball game – featuring a team that’s made it to eight of the last 11 state basketball tournaments – still draws a crowd. Fans typically have to park their cars up to four blocks away from the rafter-packed gymnasium.\\n\\n“We need to be thinking about the future and look to our younger generation about what we need to create for this community,” says Jensen.\\n\\nOff-farm Income Is Key\\n\\nSusan Wismer remembers an economy largely based on independent businesspeople like farmers when she grew up on her family’s farm near Britton, South Dakota, in the 1960s and 1970s.\\n\\nThese days, wage earners are a much larger part of the rural economy. Factories like Britton-based Horton, a manufacturer of engine-cooling solutions, are economic lifelines for the area.\\n\\n“So many farmers in the 1980s (agricultural downturn) went to work at Horton so they could buy groceries and have health insurance,” says Wismer, who represents four northeastern South Dakota counties in that state’s House of Representatives. “It allowed them to stay on the land and farm it.”\\n\\nOff-farm income is vital in helping rural areas retain farmers and residents. David Peters, an Iowa State University Extension rural sociologist, summarized income trends for Iowa farms and farm families from 2003 to 2015. He found off-farm income was vital for two types of farms.\\n\\nIntermediate farms represent 29.6% of all Iowa farms. They account for 11.8% of production values, but have lower sales and smaller acreages (220 acres per farm).\\n\\nResidence farms account for 46.1% of Iowa farms. They produce only 8.3% of sales and have small acreages (118 acres per farm).\\n\\nWhat keeps residence farms in business and with high incomes – $115,941 in 2015 – is well-paid, off-farm work, says Peters. Meanwhile, household income for intermediate farms was $83,138 in 2015. Of that, 66.2% was from off-farm work.\\n\\n“A struggling farm economy only highlights the need for nonfarm employment opportunities for all farm families,” says Peters.\\n\\nBroadband Boost Is Needed\\n\\nLack of rural broadband costs rural areas big bucks. Darrington Seward, who’s a manager for the Seward & Son Planting Company in Louise, Mississippi, noted in 2016 U.S. Senate testimony that broadband disruptions during planting can lead to improper seeding prescriptions or missed planting windows. In 2016, he estimated such events could cost the farm 5 bushels lost per acre, or $20,000 per day of lost revenue.\\n\\nThat’s something that the 37% of rural residents face who don’t have adequate or any broadband service, says Brian Cavey, CoBank’s senior vice president of government affairs.\\n\\nMuch confusion exists about which rural areas are broadband-deficient. The Federal Communications Commission uses a color-coded map showing which areas are eligible for federal broadband support. In reality, the map misses areas that could be eligible for federal funding, says Steve Berry, chief executive officer of the Competitive Carriers Association, which advocates for competitive wireless carriers and stakeholders.\\n\\nThe omnibus spending bill (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018) has $600 million in new funding that could help fund rural broadband, says Steve Censky, USDA deputy secretary.\\n\\nBerry remains skeptical. “We have $600 million in the omnibus package, but still we still do not have a map that (accurately) shows unserved and underserved areas,” says Berry. Meanwhile, $7.4 billion in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, that was supposed to go toward rural broadband service served just a few areas, he says.\\n\\nStill, public money will be needed to do the job, believes Cavey. “If we wait for for-profit entities to bring it to rural America, it will be a long wait,” he says.\\n\\nStabilizing Schools\\n\\nMonte Nipp One day, Monte Nipp thought back to his high school class in the farming community of Cresbard, South Dakota.\\n\\n“I had 35 in my class, and I can only remember one of them who didn’t have the standard nuclear two-parent family,” says Nipp, who is now superintendent of Langford Area Public School in Langford, South Dakota. “That was because one of the parents had passed away.”\\n\\nNow, children with the standard nuclear family are in the minority in some classes. That’s changed the way Nipp and faculty manage students.\\n\\n“We have one student who is tardy all the time,” says Nipp. “At first, you want to say, ‘Where’s your responsibility?’ But then, we found out his mom leaves for work at 6 a.m. He is the only person at home. Had I not had my mom or dad to get me out of bed in the morning, I probably would have been tardy quite a few times, too. He’s doing the best he can, and we are working with him.”\\n\\nStudent work has also intensified. “We have students who work 30 hours a week while they are a full-time high school student,” says Nipp. In the past, students may have worked just for spending money. Now, the money goes for car payments, paying for car insurance, or for gasoline for the car, he says.\\n\\n“My mom and dad took care of every one of my needs while I was in high school,” says Nipp. “Some of these kids now are taking care of their own needs. We try and normalize their lives as much as we can. At least from 8:30 to 3:30 during school, we can be the stability they need.”\\n\\nSeamy Side\\n\\nDale Elsen Rural America is filled with images of 4-H kids showing purple-ribbon winning steers, high school heroes scoring touchdowns, and lazy days at the lake. There’s a seamy side, though, that pervades the countryside.\\n\\nMethamphetamine ravages rural areas. “It’s the biggest drug problem we have,” says Dale Elsen, who has been Marshall County, South Dakota, sheriff since 1983.\\n\\nOther cases Elsen encounters are just plain evil. Last October, Marshall County was rocked by a report of five residents charged with multiple sexual abuse charges, including rape and possessing, manufacturing, or distributing child pornography.\\n\\nSo how can rural families keep their children on the right path?\\n\\nOne advantage small schools have is that they often need students in order to make school activities go. This keeps students busy and out of trouble while giving them a sense of belonging, says Monte Nipp, superintendent of Langford Area Public School in Langford, South Dakota.\\n\\n“Diane Hoines (play director and a retired teacher) makes it her goal to have every senior in the senior class play,” Nipp says. “She doesn’t care if you can’t sing, act, or dance, she will find a place for you.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'The USDA began preparing for a trade war with China last fall, before President Trump confronted Beijing over unfair practices or imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Tuesday. Perdue said he would prefer a speedy settlement of the tit-for-tat battle of tariffs, but, “It’s really up to China.”\\n\\nDuring a broadcast interview, Perdue said the administration recognized from the start that agriculture would be a first-round Chinese target, so he was instructed last year to draw up a plan to mitigate the impact on the sector. “There will be some,” he said. “[Farmers] can’t pay the bills with patriotism and that is what we hope to cure.” An estimated $1 of every $7 in farm exports is at risk in “the trade disruptions we are experiencing.”\\n\\n“That sounds very passive,” said Mike Allen of Axios, who conducted the interview. “In fact, it’s your president, your administration, that is disrupting trade.”\\n\\n“I still describe it as the trade disruptions we are experiencing and they understand that,” replied Perdue.\\n\\nPerdue has dropped hints off and on of USDA’s preparations. Several weeks ago, he told reporters that the budget deal approved by Congress last winter included a provision that expanded his authority to shift money among accounts. He has refused to discuss the format that trade-war aid would take. There is talk on Capitol Hill that up to $30 billion could be expended. The secretary says he will decide around Labor Day if action is needed.\\n\\n“I hope we can get this resolved prior to six months, all the trade issues,” he said, including the new NAFTA, when Allen asked what the situation would be in half a year. “It’s really up to China” to reform its practices.\\n\\nRon Kirk, who was U.S. trade representative during the Obama era, told Allen separately, “I really feel for our farmers because they paid a price for this tariff foolishness.”\\n\\n“Markets are lost already. Don’t say forever,” said Iowa Senator Charles Grassley during a teleconference. “We can win these back again.” The USDA estimated last week that U.S. soybean exports would fall by 250 million bushels annually because of the Chinese tariffs.\\n\\nEarlier on Tuesday, Japan and the European Union, accounting for one third of the global economy, signed a trade agreement that eliminates tariffs on almost all of the goods they sell to each other. The agreement includes openings for EU farm and fishery products in Japan’s consumer market. “We are sending a clear signal that we stand together against protectionism,” said European Council President Donald Tusk.\\n\\nA former U.S. trade official, Wendy Cutler, told The Japan Times that the agreement will reduce Japanese reliance on the U.S. market. Japan and the EU hope to ratify the agreement so it comes into effect in March 2019. Japan also is part of the so-called TPP11 nations who agreed to a free trade agreement after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\nJapan is the fifth largest market for U.S. farm exports. The four largest customers – China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU – have imposed tariffs on an array of U.S. goods, including food and agriculture products, in response to U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\\n\\nTo watch a video of the Axios interview with Perdue, click here.\\n\\nFor a Nikkei Asian Review description of the Japan-EU pact, click here.',\n",

       "     'text': \"Kip Tom has been nominated to serve as the US Ambassador to the United Nations for Food and Agriculture.\\n\\nTom, who runs Tom Farms in Leesburg, Indiana with operations in Argentina, served on President Donald Trump’s agriculture advisory committee during his presidential campaign. Under his leadership, Tom Farms became the largest contract seed producer for DuPont Pioneer, and is currently one of Monsanto’s largest seed producers running an operation of nearly 20,000 acres.\\n\\nTom is a keen proponent of agrifood tech adoption across the industry, trialing many startup technologies on Tom Farms, where his colleagues have recently been working with AgFunder portfolio company Solinftec as one of Solinftec’s inaugural U.S. customers. He was also an advisor to Granular, the farm management software startup that exited to DuPont last year, and earlier this year he joined online venture capital platform AgFunder’s advisory board.\\n\\n“If confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the UN for Food and Agriculture, I will look forward to serving our country and having a positive lasting impact on those around the world who are food insecure and oftentimes living in poverty or in the midst of civil conflict,” Tom told AgFunderNews. “We will need to continue to better leverage the effective resources used in the past in order to curb famine globally. But today we are at the dawn of a new area in agriculture as it relates to technology and its impact to productivity; it is my belief that the agtech sector can play a critical role around the world in developing nations. If we have the ability, we have the obligation. I challenge all of you in agtech to get involved.”\\n\\nTom serves on the boards of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the Future Farmers of America Foundation, and the National 4-H Foundation. He is also the recipient of the 2015 Agriculture Future of America Ag Leader of the Year Award.\\n\\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Tom would be the head of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome, which makes him the United States ambassador to the three United Nations agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Programme.\\n\\n“Whether it is information and technology or equipment technology, there are technologies that will help our agriculture industry deliver a sustainable, affordable, and nutritious supply of food to global consumers,” he told AgFunderNews in 2016. “It’s exciting, but what is most exciting is when we see collaboration between people in the field, who understand what we need, and developers in places like Mountain View, Palo Alto, and San Francisco. Also, we have an investment community saying this is something new that we haven’t paid much attention to.”\\n\\nEditor's Note: The author of this article is Louisa Burwood-Taylor.

       "     'text': 'The soybean market may be reflecting a worst-case scenario for tariff news. With Brazilian soybeans currently priced nearly 24% higher than exportable U.S. soybeans, the 25% tariff imposed by China is already factored into the market. That is, whether China buys beans from the U.S. or Brazil may be a moot point, as the price is close to being equal.\\n\\nChina and the U.S. are in what appears to be an escalating trade war, or as some have called it, a trade dispute. We have to wonder: If cooler heads prevail, could both sides have a victory? On one hand, President Trump may get his way, and China will purchase more U.S. products by dedicating more dollars toward U.S. products. On the other hand, soybean prices have dropped more than $2.00 a bushel. China could quickly meet its demand needs in an ever-growing demand market by purchasing lower priced U.S. commodities, in particular, soybeans. This may be wishful thinking, a far-fetched idea, or a reality. Whatever the case, we encourage U.S. farmers to be well prepared.\\n\\nWhen trade talk disputes began to surface in late winter and early spring, the writing was on the wall for prices to fall. U.S. farmers had time and the ability to take a defensive posture and shift risk. Now that the market has fallen, you have to ask the question: What if prices rally?\\n\\nProducers should consider purchasing soybean call options to retain ownership of forward sold beans for expected 2018 crop. You can also purchase call options to retain ownership of 2017 crop. By going back into the marketplace with fixed risk re-ownership, you are now positioned to take advantage of higher prices, due to news on the tariff front or the impact of weather. Soybeans are notorious for moving quickly. If you wait to gather enough information, the opportunity may well be behind you before you can take action. Pre-plan now, and be prepared.\\n\\nIf you have questions or comments, contact Top Farmer at 1-800-TOP-FARM Ext 129.\\n\\nFutures trading is not for everyone. The risk of loss in trading is substantial. Therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.

       "     'text': 'The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) announced this week that its CEO, Bob Dinneen, will step down from that job next October after leading the group since 2001 and working for RFA for more than three decades.\\n\\nThat hardly means Dinneen is retiring. Instead, as the group’s senior strategic advisor, he’ll spend more time on Capitol Hill and working with federal agencies to promote expanded use of ethanol.\\n\\nOne of his top priorities, Dinneen told Agriculture.com Thursday, is getting year-round sales of E15 and other higher blends of ethanol approved by the EPA.\\n\\n“With Scott Pruitt no longer at the agency, I have new optimism that it’s going to get done,” Dinneen said.\\n\\nPruitt, who stepped down as EPA Administrator amid scandals over his alleged misuse of federal dollars, had suggested that the oil industry needed some form of compensation for allowing sales of more ethanol in the form of E15. Dinneen argues that the industry has already benefitted from Pruitt allowing refiners to get hardship waivers from blending ethanol. That action cut domestic demand for ethanol by more than 2 billion gallons. Influential senators, including Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have questioned the legality of Pruitt’s use of a loophole intended only for small refiners.\\n\\n“We absolutely need to have some mitigation from that,” Dinneen said.\\n\\nHigher Fuel Efficiency\\n\\nDinneen is also optimistic that higher blends of ethanol, including E20 and E30, will be needed as auto manufacturers move toward selling more efficient high-compression engines. That new generation of internal combustion engines will be needed to meet higher fuel efficiency standards for the industry. They require gasoline with high levels of octane, which ethanol provides at a lower cost than other sources.\\n\\nEven though demand for electric vehicles is growing, Dinneen doesn’t see it stopping increasing demand for liquid fuels and gasoline-powered cars. Between 2016 and 2017, electric vehicle sales rose by about 16% in the U.S. but if sales continue at that rate, electric-powered cars would still be less than 10% of the market by 2030, he says.\\n\\n“I just don’t see electric vehicles as quite the threat that some do,” Dinneen said.\\n\\nDinneen has helped RFA overcome even greater challenges in the past.\\n\\nAccording to RFA’s announcement of his changing role at RFA, “During his tenure, Dinneen led the industry and achieved a number of landmark legislative and regulatory victories for ethanol, including passage of the original Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in 2005 and significant expansion and extension of the RFS program in 2007. Dinneen also played a crucial role in the creation of the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels requirements; securing the RVP waiver for E10; working with states to adopt bans on MTBE; and multiple extensions of the ethanol blender’s tax credit and secondary tariff on imported ethanol, among other important victories.”\\n\\nDramatic Expansion\\n\\nThe ethanol industry has grown dramatically during Dinneen’s career.\\n\\n“When I started we were producing 600 million gallons a year and this year we’re producing 16 billion gallons,” he said.\\n\\nEthanol has gone from an exotic fuel additive sold in a handful of states 30 years ago to being sold in every U.S. state and exported to 65 countries.\\n\\nDinneen takes the most pride in how the ethanol industry has brought economic growth and good jobs to small towns in rural America.\\n\\n“What’s meaningful for me is how the industry has helped revitalize rural communities,” he said.\\n\\nYet, Dinneen hasn’t profited personally from that growth. Early in his career he made a decision not to invest in any ethanol plant.\\n\\n“I just didn’t want to be conflicted by having ownership in any particular ethanol plant,” he said. It wasn’t a requirement of his job, but he felt it made him more effective. He admits that at times he has second thoughts, especially when the Great Recession hit and he saw his own stock portfolio shrink just as the ethanol industry was booming.\\n\\nHe is also proud of the role that RFA has taken on by providing trusted technical and analytical reports on ethanol. The RFA website even has a calculator that allows consumers to plug in the prices of different ethanol blends to see which is most cost effective.\\n\\n“We talk about consumer savings and that’s a way to demonstrate it,” he says.\\n\\n“I don’t believe you can win debates on emotion and volume alone,” he says. “Put me in the camp of ‘facts matter.’”',\n",

Lean hog\\n\\nfutures hit fresh contract lows during the session but closed\\n\\nabove those levels.\\n\\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department reports, released after the\\n\\nmarket close, were mostly in line with trade expectations.\\n\\nRanchers sent 1.3 percent more cattle to U.S. feedlots\\n\\nduring June than a year ago, according to Friday’s USDA monthly\\n\\nCattle-On-Feed report, making it the most for the month since\\n\\n2006.\\n\\nAnalysts said the report was neutral for futures action on\\n\\nMonday.\\n\\nFriday's U.S. government’s semiannual cattle inventory\\n\\nsurvey implied slower cattle herd growth, analysts said.\\n\\nMost active CME October hogs settled down 0.950 cent\\n\\nat 51.275 cents per pound while August hogs dropped 0.800\\n\\ncent to 66.450 cents.\\n\\nCME August live cattle ended 0.025 cent higher at\\n\\n108.925 cents per pound. CME October live cattle was off\\n\\n0.400 cent at 110.250 cents.\\n\\nCME August feeder cattle futures dropped 0.950 cent\\n\\nto 153.500 cents per pound and September feeders shed\\n\\n0.400 cent to 154.375 cents.\\n\\n(Reporting by Mark Weinraub; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\\n\\n© Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018.

       "     'text': 'Europe’s biggest phosphate fertilizers maker is boosting sales to the U.S. after a rival shut an aging plant and the market swung to deficit.\\n\\nPhosAgro PJSC expects to surpass the 600,000 metric tons of fertilizer it sold in the U.S. last year, and has already sold 500,000 tons, Chief Executive Officer Andrey Guryev Jr said in an interview at the company’s headquarters in Moscow. Those levels would have been unimaginable just a few years ago, when U.S. sales were only about 100,000 tons a year, he said.\\n\\nPrices for phosphate have started to recover after several years of decline as demand for the crop nutrient strengthens in markets including India and Latin America. The market is also being helped by the shuttering of aging and unprofitable plants in the U.S., notably Mosaic Co.’s Plant City operation in Florida. Those factors have helped the global market swing into a deficit of about 3 million tons, Guryev said.\\n\\nOctober 2017: Mosaic idling Plant City facility Editors\\'s note: These comments are from Mosaic\\'s Oct. 31, 2017, release on quarterly results.\\n\\n“The market is super good now for many reasons,” Elena Sakhnova, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, said by phone. The closure of Mosaic’s plant last year removed 2.5 million tons from the market, she said. “PhosAgro, a top fertilizer maker with low production costs, is one of the main beneficiaries.\"\\n\\nDemand is also growing in Latin America and in India, where import may rise by 1.5 million tons to reach a record 5.5 million tons, Guryev said. Demand in PhosAgro’s home country, Russia, is also showing 5 percent growth this year, revised from an earlier forecast of 1.5 percent growth, on the back of strong farm exports.\\n\\n\"Russia is a strategic priority and the largest, the most important market for us,\" he said. Sales in Russia doubled in the last five years to 2.3 million tons per year.\\n\\nTrade wars\\n\\nPhosAgro sees overall demand for phosphate fertilizers, measured in phosphorus pentoxide, growing by several percent from a year earlier to as much as 45.5 million tons in 2018, Guryev said.\\n\\nGuryev even sees a silver lining in U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. Retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans are prompting top buyer China to look elsewhere, boosting demand for fertilizer in Brazil and other Latin American producers. India may import more ready-to-use fertilizers after imposing duties on American phosphoric acid.\\n\\n\"The relationship between the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe is now creating huge volatility in all the markets,” Guryev said. “Potentially this will lead to a drop in global GDP, but overall volatility for the business is an opportunity to profit.\"\\n\\nFertilizer makers stand to benefit from another Chinese government policy — its plans to expand the use of ethanol gasoline in vehicles by 2020, Guryev said. The move will stoke “huge demand growth” for fertilizers to produce crops to turn into fuel, Guryev said. Possible regulations in Europe setting limits on poisons in phosphate concentrate including cadmium and arsenic may also affect the market, Guryev said. PhosAgro may benefit as it uses ores of volcanic origin that are free from harmful substances.\\n\\nFamily business\\n\\nGuryev was appointed CEO five years ago. Under his leadership, the company boosted output from 5.9 million tons to 8.3 million tons last year, and he sees that figure increasing to 9 million tons this year.\\n\\nGuryev’s family controls PhosAgro, and his father, Andrey G. Guryev, was named on the U.S. Treasury’s list of so-called oligarchs in February as a possible target for sanctions. Punitive measures brought against Oleg Deripaska and his United Co. Rusal have roiled aluminum markets and put the survival of his business into question. Guryev blames concern about sanctions for a decline in PhosAgro’s shares, which have dropped more than 20 percent in London since touching a high in January.\\n\\nPhosAgro doesn’t plan a share buyback or delisting from London as the company remains attractive to investors, Guryev said.\\n\\n\"Investors are nervous,” he said. “The logic of imposing sanctions is not clear, therefore everything that is linked to Russia is being sold.\"',\n",

Sawyer Helmer photo\\n\\nby Kalynn Sawyer Helmer\\n\\nAgriNews Staff Writer\\n\\nCORNWALL – On Wed., May 30, professional chef Mark Currier unveiled a new take on an old favourite in Cornwall. Currier held the grand opening of his Farm and Forest Food Experience, a food truck that values and celebrates an “honest, responsible and sustainable approach to food,” says Currier.\\n\\nCurrier began working in kitchens when he was 13 years old. His mom, being a professional chef, spurred an interest from an early age. When he was 18 he started his apprenticeship under what he said were very serious people in the industry. He worked in Toronto but did most of his career in Ottawa and had spent the last 13 years there until mental health issues caused Currier to take a beat. “I took a year off to step back and re-evaluate and this is what blossomed out of it,” he said.\\n\\nThe ball got rolling with Currier at the helm along with his business partners Gilles Gagner and wife, Nancy Kelly. “We wanted to give customers a new experience. We felt that Cornwall was right for this,” said Currier. The team had originally aimed to create a business in a traditional brick and mortar location but with rising costs and road blocks they revisited the food truck idea.\\n\\nThe location, at Legion Park near the baseball diamonds, is an ideal spot along the St. Lawrence River. Currier credits the find to being in the right place at the right time and getting full support from the city. “It was really an empowering thing to see our city councillors backing what we wanted to do,” he said.\\n\\nCurrier’s approach to food has been cultivated over years in the industry and having experiences working with local producers. “I believe in developing relationships with your farmers as much as with your butchers, so you know exactly where your food comes from,” he explained. Not to mention his approach helps better the local economy. “We are trying to do our best to keep our money contained within the area. It’s also to help our local farmers to get them more press and business.”\\n\\nCurrently Currier is working with O’Brien Farms in Winchester for beef, Mariposa Farm for chicken, pork, agriculture and they also act as a food distribution hub for western Ontario and eastern Quebec farms so he can get specialty game and specialty cheese, Wild Rose Organic Farm in Moose Creek, Horizon Hog Farm in Martintown and the Kinsmen Farmers Market for a lot of greens and some produce. Currier hopes to expand his relationships and add more local farmers to that list but recognized that a brand new business requires baby steps. “I’m happy to say we don’t get any meat from any major food distributors. That makes me proud.”\\n\\nThese relationships that Currier cultivates with farmers not only is beneficial to the local economy, but gives Currier a chance to show customers where their food is coming from, how it was grown, what breed of livestock it is, who it was slaughtered by and how Currier prepares it all himself. “There’s a whole story behind it. I think that’s important. People love to hear stories of where their food comes from,” Currier explained. “A lot of people are ingesting food that they have no idea what’s in it and that terrifies me. So it’s nice to be able to say things like our condiments aren’t full of nitrates and preservatives or hidden sugars. I can tell you exactly what we put into it. We make our condiments from scratch, do our buns, source all our meat from local farmers and we do our best to use as much as we can from local farms.”\\n\\nWhile almost all of Currier’s products have been sourced locally through local producers, he is one of the few who are using foraged products on the menu as well. Currier explained that when he worked in Ottawa, he was introduced to foraging. He would search for unique mushrooms, wild garlic and cattail hearts. “You want to talk sustainable, well there is a whole forest out there with neat, delicious, medicinal herbs, fruits and vegetables. There are even unique barks to cook with and when I tried my first cattail heart I couldn’t believe it, it blew my mind how delicious it was,” Currier said. If Currier doesn’t have the time to forage himself, he’ll use foragers to bring in the products.\\n\\nAlso a concern for Currier is managing the amount of waste the food truck produces. One initiative to help mitigate the issue is a pig food collaboration with Mariposa Farm. “What happens is we take a lot of our vegetable trims, our spent eggs, our leftover scraps of food and put them in pig food buckets. Once every couple weeks the farmer will come take them back to feed the pigs which in turn will fertilize the soil for the following year or following crop rotation which brings it full circle,” said Currier.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning for Currier and his sous chef Tyler Jones, a new adventure that will help shine a light on the positives of the local agricultural community. “You have to make compromises as a business but we’re trying to do the best we can with what we have. I think this is a good step. I think educating people through food, through product, through any venue is a very important thing especially in the daily living,” he said. “The fact that I can bring my favourite things in life, like gardening, foraging and cooking, together in one stop is great. We need two things in life, water and food to sustain life and I think people should celebrate them a little more.”\\n\\nFarm and Forest Food Experience is open seven days a week from 11 a.m. until 8 p.m.',\n",

Pinder-Moss photo\\n\\nby Dianne Pinder-Moss\\n\\nAgriNews Contributor\\n\\nLANARK COUNTY – Ask Mississippi Mills councillor Val Wilkinson why she would want to spend more than six hours visiting various agricultural operations in Lanark County and she makes mention of the fact she is a rural landowner and has animals herself.\\n\\n“I am interested in the farming community,” the councillor for Ramsay ward states. “I think it is important to support the farm community.”\\n\\nLikewise, Beckwith Township councillor Brian Dowdall believes that agriculture is an important industry in Lanark County and sometimes gets taken for granted.\\n\\n“A lot of people don’t see it as an industry but it is,” says the former KCAT graduate. “We have some very large operations and some small.”\\n\\nOn April 25, Dowdall and Wilkinson got to see examples of each as they took part in a farm tour organized by the Lanark Federation of Agriculture (LFA) for municipal politicians throughout the county. With the first event in October 2016 being deemed a success, the LFA decided to repeat the tour this spring.\\n\\nThe two municipal councillors were joined by four of their counterparts from throughout Lanark County – two others had confirmed but ended up being unable to attend, as well as some county staff, LFA directors and a representative of the Lanark County 4-H Association, for the tour of four agricultural operations. The County of Lanark provided the driver Andrew Joy and Thomas Cavanagh Construction Limited provided the bus.\\n\\nLFA president Lillian Drummond views the tour as “a casual way to get information back and forth” between the Federation and members of local municipal councils.\\n\\n“A lot of councillors don’t have the agricultural background that they used to at one time,” she stated in a phone interview afterward. “It’s just a way to get them familiar with some of the issues and get them a chance to understand the (agricultural) industries.”\\n\\nThe first stop of the day for the contingent was Sunol Farms Ltd. in Beckwith Township. The third generation of the Hammond family to be farming there, Amanda Hammond-O’Connell and her husband Jason O’Connell played host to the tour.\\n\\nFarming alongside Amanda’s dad Stuart who oversees the planting, haying and harvesting, Sunol is one of the largest dairy operations in the county. Approximately 130 cows are milked through a voluntary system utilizing three robots. The tour participants watched with awe as cows entered on their own the stalls for the robotic milking.\\n\\nIt’s been about three years since construction started on the robots and the O’Connells are pleased with the results. Along with the system allowing them to go to three milkings a day on average – some cows will be milked up to four times and others two – Amanda pointed out that it allows them more free time around scheduling other farm work.\\n\\nWhen asked about the cost of the robots, the couple replied that while the price tag for each has been around $200,000, they have been cost effective.\\n\\n“We find it kind of similar to having a labour payment,” Jason stated.\\n\\nCurrently, Sunol ships 10,000 to 11,000 litres of milk every two days. When the O’Connells started farming in 2006, approximately 3,500 litres were being shipped.\\n\\n“We kind of tripled our size in the last 10 years,” Jason noted.\\n\\nIn addition to the dairy operation, Sunol is also involved in cash cropping – soybeans, corn, wheat, alfalfa and grass hay – and supplies many other large dairy farms with the hay and straw they need. Likewise, Jason has partnered with his dad Kevin O’Connell on his beef farm.\\n\\nCurrently, Stuart, Amanda and Jason, with the help of two full-time employees and two students, farm more than 2,000 acres in a five-mile radius.\\n\\n“We’re constantly trying to build our land base and cow base,” Jason said. “The goal is to expand by 10 per cent per year” with some years being more, others less.\\n\\nDowdall was interested in knowing the biggest challenge for the O’Connells moving forward.\\n\\n“Right now, (it’s) access to quota,” Amanda stated, pointing out that they were dealing with a 1.5 per cent quota cut announced for the five eastern provinces due to overproduction, “which sucks.”\\n\\nIn order to meet the quota reduction, Jason said they had two options – either cut back on feed in an effort to reduce production or milk fewer cows.\\n\\nBeckwith reeve Richard Kidd who is also a LFA director, queried the O’Connells about the impact of free trade on their operation. The response from Amanda was that the various international trade deals that Canada has signed on to has resulted in the country’s dairy farmers losing access to 14 to 15 per cent of the Canadian market.\\n\\n“As a country, we could be shipping 15 per cent more milk within Canada, which is significant,” she stated.\\n\\nAfter leaving Sunol and having lunch at Temple’s Sugar Bush, which was complimentary of the LFA, the group headed to Fortune Farms outside of Almonte.\\n\\nAs Jamie Fortune welcomed those on the tour, he shared how this was very much a family business. On this day, he was joined by his parents Ray and Ruth, wife Sherry, one of his daughters Laura and her four-month-old son Harvey.\\n\\nIn what Ray Fortune said was the story of many sugar bushes, he and Ruth purchased the home property of Fortune Farms in 1972, after previously starting out on a small scale with a sugar bush near Carp that wasn’t being utilized. Based on what is known about the property, the sugar bush has been in use since the 1800s when the land was settled, he recounted.\\n\\nIn 1998, the operation was expanded with the acquisition of a second sugar bush near Clayton. Today, between the two properties, Fortune Farms has 7,400 taps with 4,300 on the home site alone.\\n\\nAlong with being federally registered as a sugar operation, Fortune Farms is also a certified maple forest and a member of the Eastern Ontario Model Forest program. Interestingly, Jamie pointed out that there are trees in the forest that are 300 to 500 years old, dating to pre-settlement.\\n\\n“There’s not another woodlot like this in Lanark County,” he highlighted. “This old growth forest is very rare and very valuable.”\\n\\nSince 1972, Fortune Farms has been partnering with the Ministry of Natural Resources in the management of the forest. To maintain diversity in the woods, there is a mixture of conifers and different species of deciduous trees, which Jamie said was very healthy for the ecosystem.\\n\\nPointing out that Lanark County is blessed with beautiful forests, which support the forest, maple syrup and tourism industries, he stressed the importance of making sure they are well managed.\\n\\n“They contribute an awful lot to our lifeline and life on the planet,” he noted. “We have to look after them.”\\n\\nFollowing Fortune Farms, the next destination was Lilbri Holsteins near Union Hall, which is owned by Brian and Lillian Drummond.\\n\\nA smaller dairy operation than seen earlier in the day, Lillian who does the milking of the herd of approximately 30 cows talked about her love of the cows and the focus on breeding.\\n\\nThe results of these efforts were evidenced by the honours filling the walls of the office in the barn. These include Lilbri Holsteins being named a 2014 recipient of a Master Breeders shield from Holstein Canada, which according to the association’s website, is “the pinnacle of success for any Holstein Canada member.”\\n\\nAs well, the farm has had numerous cows over the years be classified as “Excellent”. When asked by a municipal councillor about the classification process, Lillian explained that it relates to the confirmation of the cow and “how she looks.” Attributes like the udder, legs/feet, size and body depth are included in the evaluation.\\n\\nAs to how Lillian keeps up with everything, she replied that there’s considerably more paperwork than there used to be.\\n\\nOn the issue of international trade deals, she told the tour participants the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) — depending on the outcome of the current negotiations – are likely to be the two that have the greatest impact on the dairy industry.\\n\\n“We just have to make sure we have the best quality we can and convince Canadian consumers to buy Canadian products,” she stressed.\\n\\nThe farm tour finished off at Locustview Shorthorns in Mississippi Mills, the home of Steve and Joyce Bartlett. After previously being involved in dairy and pig farming, Steve started raising beef approximately 22 years ago. Starting off with two cows, he has built the purebred herd up to its current size of 80 head.\\n\\nIn response to a question regarding his choice of shorthorns, Steve stated that probably more breeds originated from shorthorn.\\n\\n“They are very docile, good for marbling, easy for calving,” the president of the Lanark County Association of Beef Farmers of Ontario added.\\n\\nThere are 70 acres of tillable land and 25 acres of bushland on the home property with an additional 40 acres up the road being rented for haying. While Steve remarked that it was “kind of like a one-man operation,” now that his three children are raised, he also made it clear that he has “a lot of good neighbours” that are willing to lend a helping hand.\\n\\nBeckwith deputy reeve Sharon Mousseau took part in the tour as a learning experience. In particular, she said she gained an appreciation of the commitment that farmers make to their livelihood “24/7, 365 days of the year.”\\n\\n“We take it for granted when we eat the great food they produce and drink the high quality milk,” she remarked.\\n\\nHer favourite part of the day was seeing the robotic milkers in action at Sunol Farms. The same was true for Tay Valley Township deputy reeve Brian Campbell.\\n\\n“I thought it was absolutely amazing that cows know when they need to be milked and milk themselves,” he commented, adding that he “really enjoyed” the day overall.\\n\\nWhile Carleton Place councillor Doug Black was only able to attend part of the tour, he was impressed with what he saw.\\n\\n“I have always been fascinated by the concept of people-less farming (automated processes),” he said after visiting Sunol Farms. “It was quite fascinating.”\\n\\nFor Black, being part of the tour was important, noting that members of the farming community “are our good neighbours.”\\n\\nJerry Flynn who is the deputy mayor of Carleton Place took up the invitation to be part of the tour because he wanted to see “what was going on in the farming world these days.”\\n\\n“It’s good to touch base with my roots,” he stated.\\n\\nFlynn said the event not only rekindled memories of his childhood on the farm but also reinforced “my respect for the farming industry and people who have to work so hard to maintain a living.”\\n\\nFor County of Lanark staff members like CAO Kurt Greaves, the tour was certainly worthwhile.\\n\\n“I think it was great,” he said of the experience.\\n\\nIn addition to providing an educational opportunity to get out of the office and see how members of the agricultural community “make a living,” Greaves made mention of how the tour participants got to see different topographies from prime Class 1 agricultural land, to the land that is more suitable for pasture.\\n\\nCounty tourism manager Marie White likewise enjoyed the tour.\\n\\n“The LFA Farm Tour was a fun and educational day that provided an opportunity to meet with the innovative and award-winning people working within the agricultural industry here in Lanark County,” White stated.\\n\\nThe president of the Lanark 4-H Association who was also in attendance on April 25 believes tours like these are important to experience.\\n\\n“They (the participants) see firsthand the struggles, the triumphs and the goals farmers/producers are trying to achieve and overcome,” Melissa Renaud told the AgriNews in an email response following the event. “The general public gets to witness firsthand where their food comes from, the basic steps to get it there, without going too deep on these tours. Because even from the things we got to see and watch, there is still so much more happening behind the scenes that many people will never know.”\\n\\nAs to whether the tour should be held again, Kidd replied with an emphatic “for sure.” Particularly next year, he stated, as municipal elections are being held this fall and that can often result in up to 25 to 30 per cent of the council seats in municipalities around the county being occupied by new faces.\\n\\n“It is important to get them early in their term and let them know how important agriculture is to the economy of Lanark County,” Kidd said.',\n",

The County of Lanark provided the driver Andrew Joy and Thomas Cavanagh Construction Limited provided the bus.\\n\\nLFA president Lillian Drummond views the tour as “a casual way to get information back and forth” between the Federation and members of local municipal councils.\\n\\n“A lot of councillors don’t have the agricultural background that they used to at one time,” she stated in a phone interview afterward. “It’s just a way to get them familiar with some of the issues and get them a chance to understand the (agricultural) industries.”\\n\\nThe first stop of the day for the contingent was Sunol Farms Ltd. in Beckwith Township. The third generation of the Hammond family to be farming there, Amanda Hammond-O’Connell and her husband Jason O’Connell played host to the tour.\\n\\nFarming alongside Amanda’s dad Stuart who oversees the planting, haying and harvesting, Sunol is one of the largest dairy operations in the county. Approximately 130 cows are milked through a voluntary system utilizing three robots. The tour participants watched with awe as cows entered on their own the stalls for the robotic milking.\\n\\nIt’s been about three years since construction started on the robots and the O’Connells are pleased with the results. Along with the system allowing them to go to three milkings a day on average – some cows will be milked up to four times and others two – Amanda pointed out that it allows them more free time around scheduling other farm work.\\n\\nWhen asked about the cost of the robots, the couple replied that while the price tag for each has been around $200,000, they have been cost effective.\\n\\n“We find it kind of similar to having a labour payment,” Jason stated.\\n\\nCurrently, Sunol ships 10,000 to 11,000 litres of milk every two days. When the O’Connells started farming in 2006, approximately 3,500 litres were being shipped.\\n\\n“We kind of tripled our size in the last 10 years,” Jason noted.\\n\\nIn addition to the dairy operation, Sunol is also involved in cash cropping – soybeans, corn, wheat, alfalfa and grass hay – and supplies many other large dairy farms with the hay and straw they need. Likewise, Jason has partnered with his dad Kevin O’Connell on his beef farm.\\n\\nCurrently, Stuart, Amanda and Jason, with the help of two full-time employees and two students, farm more than 2,000 acres in a five-mile radius.\\n\\n“We’re constantly trying to build our land base and cow base,” Jason said. “The goal is to expand by 10 per cent per year” with some years being more, others less.\\n\\nDowdall was interested in knowing the biggest challenge for the O’Connells moving forward.\\n\\n“Right now, (it’s) access to quota,” Amanda stated, pointing out that they were dealing with a 1.5 per cent quota cut announced for the five eastern provinces due to overproduction, “which sucks.”\\n\\nIn order to meet the quota reduction, Jason said they had two options – either cut back on feed in an effort to reduce production or milk fewer cows.\\n\\nBeckwith reeve Richard Kidd who is also a LFA director, queried the O’Connells about the impact of free trade on their operation. The response from Amanda was that the various international trade deals that Canada has signed on to has resulted in the country’s dairy farmers losing access to 14 to 15 per cent of the Canadian market.\\n\\n“As a country, we could be shipping 15 per cent more milk within Canada, which is significant,” she stated.\\n\\nAfter leaving Sunol and having lunch at Temple’s Sugar Bush, which was complimentary of the LFA, the group headed to Fortune Farms outside of Almonte.\\n\\nAs Jamie Fortune welcomed those on the tour, he shared how this was very much a family business. On this day, he was joined by his parents Ray and Ruth, wife Sherry, one of his daughters Laura and her four-month-old son Harvey.\\n\\nIn what Ray Fortune said was the story of many sugar bushes, he and Ruth purchased the home property of Fortune Farms in 1972, after previously starting out on a small scale with a sugar bush near Carp that wasn’t being utilized. Based on what is known about the property, the sugar bush has been in use since the 1800s when the land was settled, he recounted.\\n\\nIn 1998, the operation was expanded with the acquisition of a second sugar bush near Clayton. Today, between the two properties, Fortune Farms has 7,400 taps with 4,300 on the home site alone.\\n\\nAlong with being federally registered as a sugar operation, Fortune Farms is also a certified maple forest and a member of the Eastern Ontario Model Forest program. Interestingly, Jamie pointed out that there are trees in the forest that are 300 to 500 years old, dating to pre-settlement.\\n\\n“There’s not another woodlot like this in Lanark County,” he highlighted. “This old growth forest is very rare and very valuable.”\\n\\nSince 1972, Fortune Farms has been partnering with the Ministry of Natural Resources in the management of the forest. To maintain diversity in the woods, there is a mixture of conifers and different species of deciduous trees, which Jamie said was very healthy for the ecosystem.\\n\\nPointing out that Lanark County is blessed with beautiful forests, which support the forest, maple syrup and tourism industries, he stressed the importance of making sure they are well managed.\\n\\n“They contribute an awful lot to our lifeline and life on the planet,” he noted. “We have to look after them.”\\n\\nFollowing Fortune Farms, the next destination was Lilbri Holsteins near Union Hall, which is owned by Brian and Lillian Drummond.\\n\\nA smaller dairy operation than seen earlier in the day, Lillian who does the milking of the herd of approximately 30 cows talked about her love of the cows and the focus on breeding.\\n\\nThe results of these efforts were evidenced by the honours filling the walls of the office in the barn. These include Lilbri Holsteins being named a 2014 recipient of a Master Breeders shield from Holstein Canada, which according to the association’s website, is “the pinnacle of success for any Holstein Canada member.”\\n\\nAs well, the farm has had numerous cows over the years be classified as “Excellent”. When asked by a municipal councillor about the classification process, Lillian explained that it relates to the confirmation of the cow and “how she looks.” Attributes like the udder, legs/feet, size and body depth are included in the evaluation.\\n\\nAs to how Lillian keeps up with everything, she replied that there’s considerably more paperwork than there used to be.\\n\\nOn the issue of international trade deals, she told the tour participants the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) — depending on the outcome of the current negotiations – are likely to be the two that have the greatest impact on the dairy industry.\\n\\n“We just have to make sure we have the best quality we can and convince Canadian consumers to buy Canadian products,” she stressed.\\n\\nThe farm tour finished off at Locustview Shorthorns in Mississippi Mills, the home of Steve and Joyce Bartlett. After previously being involved in dairy and pig farming, Steve started raising beef approximately 22 years ago. Starting off with two cows, he has built the purebred herd up to its current size of 80 head.\\n\\nIn response to a question regarding his choice of shorthorns, Steve stated that probably more breeds originated from shorthorn.\\n\\n“They are very docile, good for marbling, easy for calving,” the president of the Lanark County Association of Beef Farmers of Ontario added.\\n\\nThere are 70 acres of tillable land and 25 acres of bushland on the home property with an additional 40 acres up the road being rented for haying. While Steve remarked that it was “kind of like a one-man operation,” now that his three children are raised, he also made it clear that he has “a lot of good neighbours” that are willing to lend a helping hand.\\n\\nBeckwith deputy reeve Sharon Mousseau took part in the tour as a learning experience. In particular, she said she gained an appreciation of the commitment that farmers make to their livelihood “24/7, 365 days of the year.”\\n\\n“We take it for granted when we eat the great food they produce and drink the high quality milk,” she remarked.\\n\\nHer favourite part of the day was seeing the robotic milkers in action at Sunol Farms. The same was true for Tay Valley Township deputy reeve Brian Campbell.\\n\\n“I thought it was absolutely amazing that cows know when they need to be milked and milk themselves,” he commented, adding that he “really enjoyed” the day overall.\\n\\nWhile Carleton Place councillor Doug Black was only able to attend part of the tour, he was impressed with what he saw.\\n\\n“I have always been fascinated by the concept of people-less farming (automated processes),” he said after visiting Sunol Farms. “It was quite fascinating.”\\n\\nFor Black, being part of the tour was important, noting that members of the farming community “are our good neighbours.”\\n\\nJerry Flynn who is the deputy mayor of Carleton Place took up the invitation to be part of the tour because he wanted to see “what was going on in the farming world these days.”\\n\\n“It’s good to touch base with my roots,” he stated.\\n\\nFlynn said the event not only rekindled memories of his childhood on the farm but also reinforced “my respect for the farming industry and people who have to work so hard to maintain a living.”\\n\\nFor County of Lanark staff members like CAO Kurt Greaves, the tour was certainly worthwhile.\\n\\n“I think it was great,” he said of the experience.\\n\\nIn addition to providing an educational opportunity to get out of the office and see how members of the agricultural community “make a living,” Greaves made mention of how the tour participants got to see different topographies from prime Class 1 agricultural land, to the land that is more suitable for pasture.\\n\\nCounty tourism manager Marie White likewise enjoyed the tour.\\n\\n“The LFA Farm Tour was a fun and educational day that provided an opportunity to meet with the innovative and award-winning people working within the agricultural industry here in Lanark County,” White stated.\\n\\nThe president of the Lanark 4-H Association who was also in attendance on April 25 believes tours like these are important to experience.\\n\\n“They (the participants) see firsthand the struggles, the triumphs and the goals farmers/producers are trying to achieve and overcome,” Melissa Renaud told the AgriNews in an email response following the event. “The general public gets to witness firsthand where their food comes from, the basic steps to get it there, without going too deep on these tours. Because even from the things we got to see and watch, there is still so much more happening behind the scenes that many people will never know.”\\n\\nAs to whether the tour should be held again, Kidd replied with an emphatic “for sure.” Particularly next year, he stated, as municipal elections are being held this fall and that can often result in up to 25 to 30 per cent of the council seats in municipalities around the county being occupied by new faces.\\n\\n“It is important to get them early in their term and let them know how important agriculture is to the economy of Lanark County,” Kidd said.',\n",

The guide also explains that most Canadian sheep are bred for meat but their wool is still useful, helping non-agriculture Canadians become familiar with a producer’s process.\\n\\nCreighton can be found at a number of fairs and shows across eastern Ontario over the summer and has been a regular at the festival since 1996.',\n",

Duff, pictured with her main performance companion Titan is renowned across North America for being the first western performer at the Sunset Ceremonies, as well as her innovative approach to training, teaching and all around horsemanship. Sawyer Helmer photo\\n\\nby Kalynn Sawyer Helmer\\n\\nAgriNews Staff Writer\\n\\nOTTAWA – Lorie Duff has been around horses for basically her whole life. She started riding at a young age, taking lessons, dreaming of becoming a great rider and creating a bond with the majestic animals the way many kids have done before.\\n\\nIn her 20s and 30s she really began her journey with horsemanship and began competing. Born and raised in Newfoundland, Duff believes in staying close to her roots. She re-located to Ontario in 2007 and founded Liberty Lane Farms in the Winchester area. Duff’s philosophy for training focuses on respect, listening to the horses and keeping an open mind.\\n\\nDuff’s reputation and skills brought her to become the first western performer to perform at the Sunset Ceremonies in Ottawa. She has now become a renowned trainer and performer across North America with her equally famous companion Titan. Her horsemanship has evolved over the last two years to become more horse-like and focus on the conversation between the horse and rider.\\n\\nDuff’s horsemanship will be tested even more in August as she will travel to Mongolia to race in the second annual Gobi Desert Cup endurance race. “I’ve never raced in an endurance race in my life and I’ve never raced in an English saddle in my life,” said Duff. Nominated to be the representative for Canada, Duff thought for a long time about whether the race was something she’d like to do. When Duff decided to accept her nomination, she felt the need to make the race mean more than just a competition. “I wanted to do it for something, I want it to mean something,” said Duff.\\n\\nDuff’s daughter was diagnosed with a rare skin disease, late last year. While it is not cancer, she is being treated with similar techniques. It was a shock but Duff said she and her family have taken each step in stride. “As with everything in our lives, we said, okay we’re going to deal with this.” The team at CHEO Duff said has been amazing. “When you go, you’re like family.”\\n\\nThat is why she approached CHEO to partner with her for the event. Duff needed to give the race a greater purpose. “It goes back to my mom who always said to me, if you’re not going to do it with love, don’t do it at all.”\\n\\nDuff had been connected to CHEO previously for a fundraising event in Winchester four years ago, this time Duff has chosen to partner with CHEO to have people pledge any amount of money per kilometre during her race. Those funds will go to the emergency care unit.\\n\\nIn order for all of that to happen, Duff needs help raising the funds required to get to the race. The nomination fee is between $7,000 and $8,000 USD, plus the travel expenses. Just to get Duff to Mongolia and entered into the race will cost close to $15,000. Currently she is fundraising to help cover those costs. “I do need support to go and I really want to go. I’m very humbled for all of the great opportunities that I’ve come across,” said Duff.\\n\\nThis is the second annual race and this year features 20 people from 16 different countries competing for the title. The 480 kilometre race spans for six days travelling 80 kilometres per day. There will be vet checks at the half-way mark each day. Racers will get a team of six Mongolian horses that have been raised to compete in endurance events through the diverse climate in the Gobi Desert. Duff and her team of horses will face temperatures ranging from 40 C in the daytime to -40 C in the evenings. Duff plans to embrace the Mongolian culture by eating traditional foods during the race and only packing the absolute necessities.\\n\\nThe race challenges the participants’ horsemanship and their ability to get six horses 480 kilometres across the desert. “This will test not just your horsemanship, it will test you as a person,” said Duff. As it stands, Duff is the only Canadian participating in the race. Her journey will be filmed by a documentary crew starting from her flight from New York. The film team will follow Duff travelling to the race and during the six day ride.\\n\\nOnce Duff arrives, she will have two days to get through registration, race preparations and meeting her horse team. Duff will have to navigate the course completely on her own, take care of her animals and get herself and each of them over the finish line. Duff will have no idea of the horse team’s level of training but that isn’t deterring her optimism. “I won’t treat it any other way than any horse that comes in for training,” she said. “When I get there I’m going to go into it really positive and hopefully build on the positivity.”\\n\\nThe race is scheduled for Aug. 22 to the 31. from Ulaanbataar to Dalanzadgad\\xad, Mongolia. “I never imagined I’d be doing this but I’m excited about the race, I wish I could take Titan with me,” said Duff.

We are currently in the second year of a four-year assessment cycle, in which the taxable assessment of farmland has increased by over 84 per cent in the United Counties of Prescott and Russell. This is in addition to very significant increases in the 2012 reassessment.\\n\\nAs a result, the tax burden of farmers in the United Counties has increased every year since 2013. Unless the council of the United Counties adjusts its tax ratio policy to reduce the farm tax ratio in 2019, the already burdensome tax load on local farmers will continue to increase until at least 2021.\\n\\nAs an upper-tier municipality, the United Counties have been given legislative authority by the provincial government to adjust the farm tax ratio anywhere between 0-0.25 in any given tax year. If the United Counties do not adjust the farm tax ratio in 2019, local farmers will be faced with upwards of $1-million in additional tax burden.\\n\\nGiven these substantial increases in property tax burden that local farmers are facing, the Prescott-Russel Federations of Agriculture urge the council of the United Counties to implement a farm tax ratio of 0.225 for the 2019 tax year. Reducing the ratio will not result in farmers paying less tax then they did the year before. This would result in slowing the increase in farm tax to a more manageable and equitable level.',\n",

This is in addition to very significant increases in the 2012 reassessment.\\n\\nAs a result, the tax burden of farmers in the United Counties has increased every year since 2013. Unless the council of the United Counties adjusts its tax ratio policy to reduce the farm tax ratio in 2019, the already burdensome tax load on local farmers will continue to increase until at least 2021.\\n\\nAs an upper-tier municipality, the United Counties have been given legislative authority by the provincial government to adjust the farm tax ratio anywhere between 0-0.25 in any given tax year. If the United Counties do not adjust the farm tax ratio in 2019, local farmers will be faced with upwards of $1-million in additional tax burden.\\n\\nGiven these substantial increases in property tax burden that local farmers are facing, the Prescott-Russel Federations of Agriculture urge the council of the United Counties to implement a farm tax ratio of 0.225 for the 2019 tax year. Reducing the ratio will not result in farmers paying less tax then they did the year before. This would result in slowing the increase in farm tax to a more manageable and equitable level.',\n",

Sawyer Helmer photo\\n\\nby Kalynn Sawyer Helmer\\n\\nAgriNews Staff Writer\\n\\nWINCHESTER — The SDSG provincial candidates met for a general meeting with the public at the Joel Steele Community Centre on Thurs., May 17. Five candidates were in attendance including, Sabile Trimm, Libertarian Party of Ontario; Jim McDonnell, Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario; Elaine Kennedy, Green Party of Ontario; Heather Megill, Liberal Party of Ontario and Marc Benoit, National Democratic Party of Ontario.\\n\\nThe candidates were each given a few minutes to present themselves, respectively. This was followed by a question period from the public in attendance and lastly, the wrap up comments. The meeting was hosted by the North Dundas Chamber of Commerce and the Dundas Federation of Agriculture. Bill Smirle acted as moderator and outlined the rules of the meeting to candidates and public members.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience members touched on Ontario’s key issues, energy, the budget, community services and agriculture. One member of the public asked early on of Kennedy and Trimm why people should consider voting for them when the larger three parties have a monopoly in the house. Kennedy told the audience, “I ran to give you a choice.” She continued that the Green Party has a long-term vision that extends past a four year government. Trimm passionately argued that no vote is wasted and any choice has an impact. She said she would like to see proportional representation to curb the idea that a vote for a party other than the big three, is a waste.\\n\\nMegill and McDonnell were often called upon to go head-to-head on questions. When asked about the current level of spending, McDonnell insisted his party would reduce wasteful spending and balance the budget, while Megill said that investment in services to better Ontario means a small deficit is necessary. She added that she has seen first hand the improvements in SDSG due to investment in infrastructure, health care and education.\\n\\nQuestions moved on to rural community services including addressing the gaps in essential services between Cornwall and its rural surroundings. Megill insisted rural communities have a right to those services. “I would work to ensure rural values are heard at the caucus table,” she said. Benoit agreed he would look at the relationships between the municipalities. He continued that it is unfair to have less funding in rural areas and expect the same level of care.\\n\\nRuby Mekker of the Concerned Citizens of North Stormont asked Megill and Benoit what they would do about the recently approved Nation Rise Wind Farm project in North Stormont. Due to the number of signatures and citizens opposing the project, Megill said she would take another look at the proposal. She explained that sustainable energy like wind turbines and solar farms are necessary to deal with the current climate crisis and that she would like to look into the deal and uncover the issues. Benoit said he is interested in listening to the concerns of the citizens and finding a solution that benefits the community and the need for green energy.\\n\\nMegill and McDonnell found some common ground in regard to the importance of local food. McDonnell said one solution is to use education and policy together. He continued that it is vital to support agriculture for the future. Megill said she would like to look into Kemptville College once more to see if it could be reopened. She was adamant about the importance of Ontario families eating and cooking local food.\\n\\nGreen energy and the Green Energy Act played a big role in Thursday’s discussion. McDonnell said he and his party are unhappy with the Act. They intend to scrap the Act and would undo any plans that could be undone in regard to the Act. He told the audience the Act is going in a tireless direction and “doesn’t use the science.” Something his party intends to do. Kennedy encouraged the long-term vision for green energy. She asked the audience what would happen when petroleum prices become increasingly high. She encouraged a balance and slow move off of fossil fuels. “It has to be done gradually,” she said. “We can’t give up on green energy, it is the future.” Benoit was in agreement. He said the economy and the environment are intertwined. He and his party want to bring Hydro One back into public hands and hopes to find a balance for green energy.\\n\\nEach candidate was given a few minutes to wrap up any thoughts on the evening. Benoit said, “20 years of their [PC and Liberal] policies have failed, it’s time for a change for the better.” Megill said that she hopes the province can move forward with a proven formula. Kennedy focused on schools and said she would like to see one school board and school in every rural community. Those schools could be used as community spaces in the evenings and weekends to help provide more social services in rural areas. She added that the governing ministries need to communicate better with one another and cut inefficiencies not jobs. McDonnell encouraged a party to clean-up from the current government. Trimm said that she hopes to focus on the three biggest issues, health care, education and hydro. “You can’t expect the people creating the problems to fix it,” she said. “The issues are not black and white, big parties are the problem.”\\n\\nAfter the wrap-up comments, the public had a chance to speak one-on-one with the candidates.

Therapy animals, service animals and riding school horses would also fall under the scope of the immunization requirements.”\\n\\nFor 4-H shows, clubs and clinics, the animals are not subject to the requirements unless the animals will come into contact with the general public. “Reasonable measures (e.g. signage, physical barriers, etc.) should be used to prevent persons not authorized to handle or interact with animals at fairs, clinics and shows from accessing animals in holding or stabling areas,” says the FAQ.\\n\\nThe problem that one owner pointed out was that the general public may possibly become more segregated from agriculture if signs warning of potential rabies are littered around the animals at events.\\n\\nFor the owners who do get the vaccines, costs can become too high to bother with the shows.

Peter Vitaliano reviews the half-year that was.\\n\\nWith half the year gone, dairy economist Peter Vitaliano of the National Milk Producers Federation has created an internal review so full of numbers it might give a non-economist a headache.\\n\\n\\n\\nHighlighter in hand, I read Vitaliano\\'s report, took two aspirin, and sat down with him to ask a few clarifying questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you were a meteorologist, not an economist, you might say the year was mostly sunny until June,\" said Vitaliano, who, in three decades of experience as a dairy economist, has seen ups and downs in global dairy markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then Mexico and China announced they would impose new, retaliatory tariffs on our dairy exports. That created big clouds of uncertainty, making the second half of 2018 difficult to forecast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking back on the first part of this year, what were some global economic highlights for U.S. dairy exporters?\\n\\n\\n\\nVitaliano cites these five:\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. exports hit a new volume record: U.S. dairy exports surged the first part of 2018, hitting an all-time volume high in April, breaking the previous month’s record. On a total milk solids basis, exports were equivalent to 18.8 percent of U.S. milk production. Volume was up 32 percent from April 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nProgress made toward \"The Next 5%\": As a percentage of U.S. production of milk solids, U.S. dairy exports increased from 14.0 percent in 2015 to 14.3 percent in 2016 and further to 14.6 percent in 2017. In the first four months of 2018, this share expanded to 16.8 percent. That is tangible progress toward \"The Next 5%,\" an industry goal to build U.S. dairy export volume from about 15 percent of U.S. milk solids to 20 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nMilk prices moved upward: By the early months of 2018, world prices for the major internationally traded dairy products had improved significantly from their low points of 2015-2016. … However, the new tariffs have the potential to erode some of that price improvement during the rest of 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nBakeries loved butterfat. The particularly strong price recovery for butter and anhydrous milkfat is due to robust demand for butterfat led by usage in the bakery sector in dairy-importing countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomic growth accelerated: The International Monetary Fund projects world economic growth will reach 3.9 percent in both 2018 and 2019, up slightly from 3.8 percent in 2017, which was the fastest worldwide growth since 2011. That, in turn, will support dairy consumption and trade.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Exports to China and Canada have also fallen due to increasing trade tensions.\\n\\nThe U.S. is expected to trade with other countries but the higher volume of pork supplies will weigh on domestic prices for the rest of the year, the report said.\\n\\nCanada\\n\\nIn Canada, pork production has declined due to productivity issues, weather-related plant closures, the lagged impact of PEDv and disruptive environmental controls, which has limited supply, the report noted.\\n\\nAlthough production may slow throughout the summer, it should gradually increase during the fall and winter.\\n\\nDomestic demand for pork has been supportive of prices but, with growing U.S. supplies, Rabobank analysts expect increased competition will pressure Canadian pork values.\\n\\nThe analysts also expect poor returns and soft demand from the U.S., which may limit growth of the Canadian sow herd this year.\\n\\nOverall, Canadian pork exports were down in April and a sharp fall in shipments to China reflects a surplus of pork in that market, the report said.\\n\\nHowever, Canada’s focus on developing a market in Japan has led to an increase in shipments to this high-value market.\\n\\nCanadian exports to Mexico have also picked up, following the American disruption, the report said. Canadian producers are expected to benefit from the trade tensions between the U.S. and Mexico, as Canada may provide less complicated logistics than some of its competitors.\\n\\nCanadian exports to China will improve due to the latter county’s trade tensions with the U.S., Rabobank analysts predict.',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Carl Zulauf\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics\\n\\nOhio State University\\n\\nJonathan Coppess, Nick Paulson,and Gary Schnitkey\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics\\n\\nUniversity of Illinois\\n\\nWith the implementation of tariffs taking effect, President Donald Trump’s trade policy has roiled commodity markets. Tariffs have been imposed on U.S. imports, triggering counter-tariffs on U.S. exports with ag commodities a common target (see farmdoc daily April 17, 2018 for example). Existing trade agreements, notably NAFTA, have also been reopened. These events bring to mind the partial embargo of U.S. ag exports to the Soviet Union imposed on January 4, 1980 by President Jimmy Carter in response to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. It was lifted by President Ronald Reagan on April 24, 1981. This article examines U.S. exports of corn, soybeans, and wheat in long term perspective with a focus on the USSR grain embargo period. Its focus is U.S. exports to the world, not just to the USSR. Quantity of U.S. corn, soybean, and wheat exports were little impacted during the years of the USSR grain embargo, but declined in the years that followed. Moreover, U.S. corn and wheat exports have never really exceeded the quantity they reached in the early 1980s.\\n\\nBackground and Data\\n\\nThe USSR grain embargo of 1980 was a partial, not total embargo on a wide range of agricultural products, including grains, oilseeds, as well as meat and livestock products. Sales to the USSR remained large as previous trade commitments were honored. It is also important to note that it was the 4th U.S. embargo or moratorium on exports since 1973. The first was a ban on all exports of soybeans, cottonseed, and their products during the summer of 1973 in response to very high soybean prices and concern about domestic U.S. supplies. The second and third were U.S. moratoria on export sales to the USSR in 1974 and to the USSR and Poland in 1975 as a response to the U.S. drought of 1974 and USSR drought of 1975. While the USSR embargo of 1980 has garnered the most attention over time, it is more likely that 4 embargos / moratoria in a span of 7 years had a cumulative effect that exceeded their individual effect. For an extensive and excellent discussion of these embargos and moratoria, with a focus on the 1980 embargo, see the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service (ERS) report published in November 1986.\\n\\nThe data used in this study are U.S. and world exports of corn, soybeans, and wheat measured in million metric tons (MMTs). Source is “PSD online” (USDA, Foreign Agriculture Service). The analysis starts with the 1964/65 (1964) crop year, the first year data are reported for soybeans.\\n\\nU.S. Exports in Long Term Historical Perspective\\n\\nQuantity of U.S. exports of corn, soybeans and wheat rose by 373%, 67%, and 104%, respectively, from 1970 to 1980 (see Figure 1). Corn exports have never really exceeded the 61 MMTs exported during the 1979 crop year, although exports were slightly larger in 2007 at 62 MMTs. Wheat exports peaked at 48 MMTs in 1981, a level never approached since. Next highest year was 1987 at 43 MMTs. Soybean exports did not consistently exceed their late 1970/early 1980 level until the late 1990s. Peak exports are 59 MMTs in 2016.\\n\\nIn contrast to the U.S., exports of wheat by the rest-of-the-world (ROW) increased consistently after 1980 (see Figure 2). ROW soybean exports remained stable from 1980 through 1985, then began to increase consistently. The rate of increase accelerated after 1995 with China’s emergence as a major importer. ROW corn exports were erratic around their 1980 level until 1990, then began to increase. Interestingly, ROW corn and soybean export quantity have tracked one another since the mid-1990s.\\n\\nU.S. share of world corn and wheat exports rose during the 1970s (see Figure 3). U.S. soybean share began to decline after 1976 as South America emerged as an exporter. Since 1980, U.S. soybean and wheat share has declined fairly consistently at annual rates of -1.3 and -0.7 percentage points, respectively. Corn’s share declined erratically at a rate of -0.3 percentage point per year between 1980 and 2000. Decline has since accelerated to -2.2 percentage points per year, with decline particularly large from 2007 to 2011.\\n\\nUSSR Grain Embargo\\n\\nU.S. corn, soybean, and wheat exports were, respectively, 20%, 11%, and 25% higher in 1979-80 than in 1977-78 (see Figure 4). Wheat exports were the same in 1983-84 as 1979-80, but 1983-84 U.S. corn and soybean exports were less than in 1979-80 and even 1977-78. Corn and wheat exports in the pairs of years after 1984 were lower than in 1979-80. Soybean exports were higher, but only markedly so in 2016-17. The pairs of years, in chronological order, precede the embargo; cover the embargo years, immediately precede the 1985 farm bill’s substantial reduction in U.S. prices to stimulate demand, and then at roughly 10 year intervals.\\n\\nAs with quantity of U.S. soybean and wheat exports, U.S. share of world exports for these crops was higher in 1979-80 than 1977-78 (see Figure 5). U.S. corn export share was slightly lower in 1979-80, possibly due to the U.S. drought of 1980. By 1983-84, U.S. share was lower than even in 1977-78 for all 3 crops. Other than for corn in 1995-96, U.S. share is lower for all pairs of years since.\\n\\nThe USDA, ERS report of November 1986 concluded that, while international trade was rearranged, the embargos and moratoria had limited impact on the quantity of U.S. exports in the short run. While acknowledging the difficulty in assessing long-term impacts, it attributed most of the decline in U.S. exports that followed the 1980 USSR grain embargo to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar and a slowing of world economic growth. In addition, already high loan rates were raised for corn and wheat in the wake of the 1980 USSR grain embargo. As a result, U.S. policy provided an umbrella for the rest of the world to expand production. This umbrella remained in place until the 1985 farm bill substantially reduced loan rates. Clearly, all these factors would negatively impact U.S. exports. However, given (1) U.S. exports of corn and wheat have never exceeded early 1980 levels despite long term world economic growth, large fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, and the dramatic U.S. farm policy changes in 1985; (2) U.S. share of world exports for all 3 crops has continued to decline; and (3) nearly 40 instead of 5 years have passed; it is reasonable to ask whether the long term impact of the embargos and moratoria of the 1970s/1980s was more than this study suggests?\\n\\nSummary Observations',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The forecasts for 2018 red meat and poultry production are raised from last month. The beef production forecast is raised on higher expected cow slaughter in the third quarter. USDA will release the Cattle report on July 20th, providing a mid-year estimate of the U.S. cattle inventory as well as producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for beef cow replacement. Forecast pork production is raised from last month as higher expected second-half hog slaughter more than offsets lower second-quarter slaughter. A more rapid pace of hog slaughter is expected in the third quarter and USDA’s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated the March-May pig crop was 4 percent above 2017 which will result in higher fourth-quarter hog slaughter. Second and third-quarter broiler production is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights. Turkey production is raised slightly on production data to date. Egg production is raised from the previous month as egg prices are forecast higher and feed costs lower.\\n\\nFor 2019, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised as increases in pork and broiler production more than offsets expected declines in beef production. Forecast beef production is reduced from the previous month on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter the first half of the year. The pork production forecast is raised; the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated that producers intend to farrow 2 percent more hogs over the next two quarters, which coupled with expected growth in pigs per litter will push first-half hog slaughter higher. Forecast broiler and egg production is also raised from the previous month, as higher prices and lower expected feed prices support continued expansion. Forecast turkey production is unchanged from the previous month. The beef import forecast is unchanged for 2018, but the export forecast is raised from the previous month on recent trade data and continued strong exports to Asia. The 2019 beef export forecast is also raised from last month. Pork trade forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from the previous month. Lower pork product prices are expected to help offset increased competition in key markets in 2019. No change is made to 2018 and 2019 broiler and turkey export forecasts. The 2018 egg export forecast is raised on recent trade data, but no change is made to the outlying quarters. Small revisions are made to historical trade estimates. The cattle price forecast for 2018 is lowered slightly from last month, reflecting June price data. Forecast 2019 cattle prices are unchanged from the previous month. The hog price forecast is raised for 2018 as recent price strength and expected higher prices in the third quarter more than offset lower prices in the fourth quarter. The hog price forecast for 2019 is lowered on increased supplies of pork. Broiler prices are raised for 2018 on current price strength while turkey prices are unchanged. No changes are made for 2019 broiler and turkey price forecasts. Egg prices are raised for 2018 on higher-than-expected prices to date. The 2019 egg price is reduced slightly on increased supplies.\\n\\nMilk production forecasts for both 2018 and 2019 are lowered from last month on slower-thananticipated growth in milk per cow and lower cow numbers. Although tempered by lower expected feed costs, lower milk prices will likely weaken producer margins, resulting in lower cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow. USDA’s Cattle report, to be released on July 20th, will provide a midyear estimate of dairy cow and dairy replacement heifer inventories.\\n\\nFor 2018, the fat basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on higher imports of butterfat products. Fat basis imports are unchanged for 2019. The 2018 fat basis export forecast is unchanged from the previous month but is raised for 2019 as the U.S. is expected to be price competitive and higher expected exports of butterfat products will more than offset expected declines in cheese exports. Skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from the previous month. However, skim-solids basis exports for 2018 and 2019 are reduced from the previous month primarily on lower expected exports of skim milk powder and whey products as China’s tariffs on certain U.S. dairy products hampers exports to some extent.\\n\\nThe 2018 butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month. Forecasts are reduced for cheese, NDM, and whey prices for 2019 as cheese stocks will remain large and prices for NDM and whey will have to remain competitive with competing exporters. However, the 2019 butter price is raised as stocks are worked down. The 2018 and 2019 Class III price and Class IV price forecasts are lowered from last month. The 2018 all milk price is forecast at $15.95 to $16.25 and the price for 2019 is $16.25 to $17.25 per cwt.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Dorivar Ruiz Diaz\\n\\nWhen crop fields appear variable, one question commonly asked is whether this is due to a nutrient problem. An excellent tool that can be used to answer this question is plant analysis or tissue testing.\\n\\nAs with corn, wheat, and other crops, there are two primary ways plant analysis can be used: as a routine monitoring tool to ensure nutrient levels are adequate in the plant in normal or good looking crops, and as a diagnostic tool to help explain some of the variability and problems we see in soybean growth and appearance in fields.\\n\\nPlant analysis as a routine monitoring tool\\n\\nFor monitoring nutrient levels purposes, collect 20-30 sets of the upper, fully developed trifoliate leaves, less the petiole, at random from the field anytime between flowering and initial pod set (growth stages R1-4). The top fully developed leaves are generally the dark green leaves visible at the top of the canopy, which are attached at the second or third node down from the top of the stem.\\n\\nSampling later, once seed development begins, will give lower nutrient contents since the soybean plant begins to translocate nutrients from the leaves to the developing seed very quickly. Sampling leaf tissue under severe stress conditions for monitoring purposes can also give misleading results and is not recommended.\\n\\nThe sampled leaves should be allowed to wilt overnight to remove excess moisture, placed in a paper bag or mailing envelope, and shipped to a lab for analysis. Producers should not place the leaves in a plastic bag or other tightly sealed container, as they will begin to rot and decompose during transport, and the sample won\\'t be usable.\\n\\nWhich nutrients should you request analysis?\\n\\nIn Kansas, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) are the nutrients most likely to be deficient in soybeans. Normally the best values are the “bundles” or “packages” of tests offered through many of the labs. The packages can be as simple as N, P and K, or can consist of all of the 14 mineral elements considered essential to plants. K-State offers a package that includes N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn for $32.00.\\n\\nThe data returned from the lab will be reported as the concentration of nutrient elements, or potentially toxic elements in the plants. Units reported will normally be in terms of “percent” for the primary and secondary nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) and “ppm,” or parts per million, for the micronutrients (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, B, Mo, and Al). Most labs/agronomists compare plant nutrient concentrations to published sufficiency ranges. A sufficiency range is simply the range of concentrations normally found in healthy, productive plants during surveys. A diagram explaining this concept is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 1. Example of plant analysis interpretation using the concept of a sufficiency range.\\n\\nTable 1 gives the range of nutrient content considered to be \"normal\" or \"sufficient\" for top, fully developed soybean leaves at early pod set. Keep in mind that these are the ranges normally found in healthy, productive soybeans.\\n\\nTable 1. Nutrient content considered “normal” or “sufficient” for soybeans\\n\\nNutrient Units Growth Stage\\n\\n(Top, fully developed leaves at pod set) Nitrogen % 4.25-5.50 Phosphorus % 0.25-0.5 Potassium % 1.70-2.50 Calcium % 0.35-2.00 Magnesium % 0.26-1.00 Sulfur % 0.15-0.50 Copper ppm 10-30 Iron ppm 50-350 Manganese ppm 20-100 Zinc ppm 20-50 Boron ppm 20-55 Molybdenum ppm 1.0-5.0 Aluminum ppm <200\\n\\nPlant analysis as a diagnostic tool\\n\\nPlant analysis is an excellent diagnostic tool to help understand some of the variation seen in the field. When using plant analysis to diagnose field problems, producers should try to take comparison samples from both good/normal areas of the field, and problem areas. Collect soil samples from the same good and bad areas, and don’t wait for flowering to sample soybeans. Early in the season, when plants are 8-10 inches tall, collect whole plants from 15 to 20 different places in the sampling areas. Later in the season, collect 20-30 sets of top, fully developed leaves. Handle the samples the same as those for monitoring, allowing them to wilt to remove excess moisture, and avoiding mailing in plastic bags.\\n\\nSoil samples are important in diagnostic work, because while a plant may be deficient in a nutrient, it may not be due to a shortage in the soil. Other factors such as soil compaction, insect or disease damage to the roots, low pH limiting nodulation, or many other issues can limit nutrient uptake in soybeans.\\n\\nPlant samples can be sent to the K-State Soil Testing Laboratory for analysis at:\\n\\nK-State Research and Extension\\n\\n2308 Throckmorton PSC\\n\\n1712 Claflin Rd.\\n\\nManhattan, KS 66506-5503\\n\\nFor more information on plant analysis testing, including available tests, forms, and costs, please visit the K-State Soil Testing Lab website at:\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIn summary, plant analysis is a good tool producers can use to monitor the sufficiency of soil fertility levels and inoculant effectiveness, and a very effective diagnostic tool. Producers should consider adding this to their toolbox.',\n",

The roots of the trade war between the two countries are linked to “China’s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its forced technology transfers,” Dave Warner, NPPC’s director of communications, said to Farms.com today.\\n\\nAnd China already had a 12 per cent tariff on U.S. pork.\\n\\nChina represents an important market for American pork producers, as the country accounted for 17 per cent of the total value of U.S. exports last year.\\n\\nAs of Friday, American producers also face a 10 percent tariff increase from Mexico, raising that country’s total tax to 20 per cent.\\n\\n“Both of those markets are very important to U.S. pork producers,” Warner said.\\n\\n“Mexico is the U.S. pork industry’s number two export market, taking $1.5 billion (worth) of U.S. pork in 2017, and China is the number three export market, importing $1.1 billion last year.”\\n\\nEconomists from Iowa State University calculated that, from March through to May, producers lost $18 per hog or more than $2 billion on an annualized basis, the release said.\\n\\n“The Trump administration has said it will help farmers hurt by the ongoing trade disputes, but it remains to be seen the form that will take,” Warner said.\\n\\n“One possible action, which has been used by USDA in the past, is a supplemental purchase of pork for federal food programs, such as for the military, federal prisons and the needy.”\\n\\nThe American government has also helped pork producers by opening new markets in Argentina and Paraguay. “They aren’t huge markets, but every little bit helps, and Argentina … has great growth potential,” Warner added.\\n\\nNPPC continues to urge the administration to end the trade disputes as soon as possible and to do whatever it can to help America’s farmers. The organization also advocates for the maintenance and expansion of existing export markets, and the opening of new ones.\\n\\nPrevious Farms.com coverage on retaliatory tariffs can be found here.\\n\\nRGtimeline/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Chris Hurt\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural Economics\\n\\nPurdue University\\n\\nThe pork industry appears to be headed for a period of large losses in which excess pork supplies force prices below costs of production. In addition, demand will likely be weakened by reduced exports with tariffs in place on U.S. pork exports to China and Mexico. On a positive note, Chinese tariffs on U.S. grains and soybeans are helping to erode feed prices along with favorable growing season weather.\\n\\nThe industry has expanded the breeding herd by three percent according to a recent producer survey by USDA. This is the highest rate of breeding herd expansion since this expansion phase began in 2015. A breeding herd of this magnitude is likely to be a primary contributor to excess supplies in 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nThe market herd was up three percent and farrowing intentions for this summer and fall were up two percent. With the breeding herd up three percent, there is concern that actual farrowings this summer and fall could be higher than the two percent increase recorded by survey respondents.\\n\\nPork supplies will be large. First-half supplies this year have been up four percent and are expected to rise to five percent higher in the third quarter this summer and four percent higher in the final quarter of 2018. Current expected supplies for the first-half of 2019 are up four percent and three percent in the last-half of 2019.\\n\\nThe second driver of the large losses facing the pork industry revolve around the current trade war the U.S. has entered. The U.S. pork industry has done an amazing job of producing low costs and high value pork products and adapting them to our foreign customers. As a result we have targeted exports as a strategic objective to grow the U.S. pork industry. Our success in growing exports to 22 percent of production means that pork became a target of both China and Mexico.\\n\\nPork exports started the year with a lot of promise being up nine percent at the end of April compared to the January to April period last year. Chinese tariffs on U.S. pork began on April 2 and were raised again on July 6 making additional tariffs of at least 50 percent. Mexico placed tariffs on U.S. pork of ten percent on June 5, and raised those to 20 percent on July 5.\\n\\nWeekly export data from USDA suggests a sharp drop in pork export sales during the month of June representing about a 25 percent decrease from last year. Weakness in exports will be expected as long as the tariffs stay in place. China has also placed tariffs on U.S. beef and poultry which may reduce U.S. exports of these competitive meats.\\n\\nJust how large are the loss prospects right now considering the large pork supplies, reduced exports due to tariffs, and reduced feed prices due to tariffs and favorable growing conditions?\\n\\nLiveweight prices for 51-52 percent lean carcasses are expected to average about $49 in the third quarter of 2018 before dropping sharply in the last quarter to near $40. Current estimates of cost of production are near $50.\\n\\nIn 2019, prices are expected to be below costs for much of the year. Liveweight prices are expected to be in the low $40’s in the first quarter and then move to near $50 for averages in the second and third quarter before dropping back to the low $40’s for the final quarter.\\n\\nEstimated losses are expected to be large this fall and winter with losses averaging about $25 per head for this six month period. Hog prices may be close to breakeven in the second and third quarters before returning to losses greater than $20 per head in the last quarter of 2019. Losses for the calendar year of 2018 are estimated at a loss of $10 per head and $12 per head of loss in 2019.\\n\\nFeed costs are expected to be somewhat lower in the second-half of 2018 versus the first-half. This is especially true for soybean meal where Decatur, Illinois prices for high protein meal were near $365 per ton in the first-half. That same price in the second-half is expected to be closer to $340 per ton. Unfortunately, corn costs may be similar in both halves of the year and thus the modestly lower feed costs are not enough to offset low hog prices.\\n\\nMy prices for hogs and feed are primarily based on futures prices on July 9. Clearly, agricultural product markets are in a period of high uncertainty and volatility. Weather will continue to be a driver of crop prices over the next six to eight weeks. What happens to tariffs on U.S. exports of crops and animal products will also add dynamic price potential.\\n\\nGiven the heightened level of uncertainty, most pork producers will not want to make long-term decisions at this point. That means carrying on as best they can with short-term plans. The current trade war that agriculture has been unwillingly forced to participate in has an unknown and difficult to predict outcome. Only time will help bring the “end game” into better focus.',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Rachel Purdy and Michael Langemeier\\n\\nCenter for Commercial Agriculture\\n\\nPurdue University\\n\\nExamining the competitiveness of wheat production in different regions of the world is often difficult due to lack of comparable data and consensus regarding what needs to be measured. To be useful, international data needs to be expressed in common production units and converted to a common currency. Also, production and cost measures need to be consistently defined across production regions or farms.\\n\\nThis paper examines the competitiveness of wheat production for important international wheat regions using 2013 to 2016 data from the agri benchmark network. Earlier work examined international benchmarks for the 2013 to 2015 period (farmdoc daily September 23, 2016). The agri benchmark network collects data on beef, cash crops, dairy, pigs and poultry, horticulture, and organic products. There are 38 countries represented in the cash crop network. The agri benchmark concept of typical farms was developed to understand and compare current farm production systems around the world. Participant countries follow a standard procedure to create typical farms that are representative of national farm output shares, and categorized by production system or combination of enterprises and structural features.\\n\\nThe sample of farms used in this paper was comprised of ten typical farms from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and United States. The farm and country abbreviations used in this paper are listed in table 1. Typical farms used in the agri benchmark network are defined using country initials and hectares on the farm. It is important to note that wheat enterprise data is collected from other countries. These seven countries represented in table 1 were selected to simplify the illustration of costs and discussion. There are three U.S. farms with wheat in the network. The U.S. farms used to illustrate wheat production in this paper is the western Kansas farm (US2025KS) and the southern Indiana farm (US1215INS).\\n\\nAll of the typical farms listed in table 1 produced multiple crops. The Argentine farm produced soybeans, corn, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The Australian farm produced barley, fodder, rapeseed, and summer wheat. The Canadian farm located in the Red River Valley produced barley, rapeseed, soybeans, summer wheat, and winter wheat. The Canadian farm located in Saskatchewan produced linseed, oats, peas, rapeseed, barley, and summer wheat. The German farm produced rapeseed, sugar beets, and winter wheat. The smaller Ukraine farm produced corn, rapeseed, soybeans, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The larger Ukraine farm produced corn, soybeans, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The southern Indiana farm produced corn, soybeans, and winter wheat. The production of winter wheat on the southern Indiana farm enables this farm to produce double-crop soybeans. The Kansas farm produced corn (both irrigated and non-irrigated) and winter wheat.\\n\\nWheat Yields\\n\\nAlthough yield is only a partial gauge of performance, it reflects the available production technology across farms. Average wheat yield for the farms in 2013 to 2016 was 66.8 bushels per acre (4.49 metric tons per hectare). Figure 1 illustrates average wheat yield per hectare for each typical farm. Average farm yields ranged from approximately 30.3 bushels per acre (2.04 metric tons per hectare) for the typical farm in Australia to 138.8 bushels per acre (9.33 metric tons per hectare) for the German farm. The Indiana farm had an average yield of 64.8 bushels per acre (4.36 metric tons per hectare) while the Kansas farm had an average yield of 40.6 bushels per acre (2.73 metric tons per hectare).\\n\\nInput Cost Shares\\n\\nDue to differences in technology adoption, input prices, fertility levels, efficiency of farm operators, trade policy restrictions, exchange rate effects, and labor and capital market constraints, input use varies across typical wheat farms. Figure 2 presents the average input cost shares for each farm. Cost shares were broken down into three major categories: direct costs, operating costs, and overhead costs. Direct costs included seed, fertilizer, crop protection, crop insurance, and interest on these cost items. Operating cost included labor, machinery depreciation and interest, fuel, and repairs. Overhead cost included land, building depreciation and interest, property taxes, general insurance, and miscellaneous cost.\\n\\nThe average input cost shares were 37.3 percent for direct cost, 37.4 percent for operating cost, and 25.4 percent for overhead cost. The Kansas farm had an above average cost share for direct cost at 40.1 percent, and a below average cost share for operating cost and overhead cost. Crop establishment costs are a large proportion of direct cost. The Indiana farm had an above average cost share for overhead cost at 45.3 percent and a below average cost share for direct costs and operating cost. The German farm also had a relatively high cost share for overhead cost. The relatively large cost share for overhead cost in Indiana and Germany largely reflects relatively high land costs. The Indiana farm had the smallest cost share for operating cost out of the sample analyzed at 18 percent.\\n\\nFigures 3 and 4 present seed, fertilizer, and pesticide cost per hectare and per ton for each of the typical farms. Compared to the U.S. farms, seed and fertilizer costs per hectare are relatively low in Australia. As noted above, the German farm had, by far, the highest yield per hectare. However, its establishment cost ($461 per hectare) is more than 80 percent above the average of the typical farms in the sample. Of the farms selected, the German farm had the highest seed, pesticide, and fertilizer costs per hectare. On a per hectare basis, the Indiana farm had the lowest pesticide cost, but this farm also had the highest seed cost. The Indiana farm’s pesticide costs were approximately 40 percent below the average.\\n\\nRevenue and Cost\\n\\nFigures 5 and 6 present average gross revenue and cost per hectare and per ton for each typical farm. Gross revenue and cost are reported as U.S. dollars per hectare and per ton. Wheat is a major enterprise on all of the typical farms presented in figures 5 and 6. It is obvious from figures 5 and 6 that gross revenue per hectare and per ton are substantially higher for the German farm. However, cost is also substantially higher for this farm. In fact, the German farm had the highest direct cost, operating cost, and overhead cost per hectare. However, on a per ton basis, the German farm had below average direct and operating cost, and above average overhead cost.\\n\\nThree of the selected typical farms had a negative economic profit during the 2013 to 2016 time period. Average losses for the typical farms from Argentina, Indiana, and Kansas were $57, $101, and $4 per acre, respectively during the four year period ($140, $249, $9 per hectare, respectively). The highest economic profit earned was $60 per acre ($148 per hectare) for the typical Russia farm. Despite having the lowest gross revenue per acre at $172 ($425 per hectare), the Australian farm had an average economic profit of $8 per acre ($20 per hectare) during the four-year period.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThis paper examined yield, gross revenue, and cost for farms with a wheat enterprise in the agri benchmark network from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and United States. Although the typical German farm had the highest yields, that farm also realized the highest seed, pesticide, and fertilizer costs per hectare. Both of the farms in the United States realized an economic loss during the 2013 to 2016 time period.',\n",

       "     'text': \"Thanks to great advances in precision ag technology, we now understand that crops grow in a five-dimensional sea of variability – up, down, right, left... plus time and economics.\\n\\nTo optimize yield and ROI, keeping budgets and the environment in mind, we need to manage crops using greater focus.\\n\\nFortunately, as technology improves and our understanding of how to use the information generated by that technology grows, so too does our ability to begin to manage agronomics in a a more precise manner.\\n\\nTIME TO EXPAND YOUR TECHNOLOGY TOOLBOX!\\n\\nFarmers have an ever-expanding toolbox of technology that can help them get more and more efficient with inputs and logistics, with less worry and stress. For the purposes of this blog, we're going to link three technologies: yield monitors, tissue tests and remote weather stations (primarily rain gauges) by considering them as different, yet complimentary lenses into a farm operation — much like a compound microscope with the eyepiece lens works in concert with the rotating objective lenses to have ever-increasing magnification levels.\\n\\n1: LEVERAGE YIELD MONITORS\\n\\nYield monitors are like the eyepiece lens of the microscope as it expresses farm data at the coarsest level with big picture focus. Yield is the final integration of everything that has happened in every particular field for that specific year – rainfall, climate, tillage system, rotation, pest control, seeding, nutrient management, etc. Taken from the yield monitor and formatted into a yield map, this is where the yield data really becomes a powerful tool as we ask ourselves, 'Why does this portion of the field yield differently than that portion of the field?'\\n\\nTaken one-step further, using yield maps plus as-applied maps and real costs, we can produce profit maps that visually show us which fields or parts of fields were most profitable. Which should make us ask, 'Why is this portion of the field more profitable than that portion of the field? Answering the 'why' provides a foundation for subsequent year’s crop production. Unfortunately, very few growers understand the full value of their yield data. We want to change that.\\n\\n2: MONITOR RAINFALL\\n\\nIn Grandpa’s day, a single rain gauge near the homestead was a best management practice. Now we have access to remote rain gauges, whether it on-farm weather stations or premium weather feeds. This next lens of resolution enables us to manage on a much finer scale is becoming the new best management practice.\\n\\nAs farms grow in size, fields become more distant and scattered. It’s not unusual for a farm to have fields 20–30 miles apart. A lot can happen over this distance making it extremely difficult to manage individual fields that are miles from the homestead.\\n\\nSo what do we do? We drive around an awful lot! The map above is a screen shot of a Trimble Ag Software Premium Weather feed showing an example of where a significant rainfall event took place. The home yard received no rain while numerous fields received 1+ inches, making field operations impossible while significantly enhancing yield potential and disease pressure. With this type of information, we can focus to make better logistical decisions while also identifying fields with higher yield/disease potential thereby further focusing specific in field decisions/operations. Remember, water drives everything and an additional 1 inch of precipitation can easily translate into 7+ bu/ac of canola!, which requires additional nutrient input to be captured.\\n\\n3: EMBRACE TISSUE TESTS\\n\\nThis brings us to the next level of resolution or lens to look through and that is the tissue test. Now that we know based on our yield maps and perhaps our rainfall maps, where the yield potential is significantly greater. We can now employ tissue tests to see exactly how the crop is tracking nutritionally and if additional nutrients are required, especially nitrogen, sulphur and boron(all soil mobile) for canola, then we can pull soil/foliar applied triggers to capture that yield once the field is trafficable again.\\n\\nThere are many other tools available such as soil tests, resin tests or imagery when used properly can help sharpen our agronomic focus. Sometimes we can fall, mistakenly, into the trap of looking at technology/tools as just another expense, but in the right hands and used with the goal of dialing in to create greater efficiencies, they are an investment.\\n\\nWe are excited with the agronomic insights these tool provide agronomists, who can then pass them on to growers. Consider the technologies coming at us as transformative lenses that allow us to visualize the world in completely different ways, allowing better decisions, more efficient re-allocation of scarce resources, greater profitability AND environmental enhancement.\\n\\nAs we integrate these lenses of insight, our ability to manage profit expands... exponentially.\",\n",

Farmers can use CTIS to control tire pressures from their tractor cabs.\\n\\nThe CTIS capabilities allow the tires to operate at low pressure rates, which have added benefits, said David Graden, agriculture operational marketing manager for Michelin.\\n\\n“The tires have exceptional field traction and performance,” he told Farms.com today. “They can run as low as 9 psi in singles and 6 psi at field operating speeds in duals.”\\n\\nAside from traction benefits, operating at the AxioBib2 tires at low psi levels may also help growers increase yields, Graden said.\\n\\n“The University of Illinois did a study on soil compaction and impact on yield,” he said. “Researchers have seen about a 4.3 percent yield gain in corn by using Michelin tires.”\\n\\nProducers should take a practical approach to selecting tires.\\n\\nMuch like purchasing a car, testing the tires before buying them will give farmers an idea of how the tires handle and if they will be a worthwhile investment.\\n\\n“Farmers are getting hit with everything at every angle,” Graden said. “Go drive on the tire, tell us what you think and how you feel about it. It’s the best way to know if the tire is right for your equipment or your farm.”\\n\\nThe AxioBib2 is available in 710/60R42 and 600/60R30 sizes. More sizes will be available in 2019.\\n\\nMichelin also introduced its CrossGrip radial tire for road, grass and snowy conditions.\\n\\nThe tire is designed for loaders, backhoes, telehandlers and tractors. It has 196 tread blocks per wheel rotation and an optimized tread depth to reduce damage during the growing season.\\n\\nFarmers can purchase the CrossGrip as of Aug. 1. The tires are available in 250/80R16, 400/80R24, 440/80R24 and 440/80R28 sizes.\\n\\nMichelin photo',\n",

FCC also increased lending in the agri-food and agribusiness sector, supporting young entrepreneurs and helping business operators become leaders in job creation and innovation.\\n\\n“Innovation spurs increased productivity and competitiveness,” Hoffort said. “We understand the needs of our customers across the agriculture value chain, from primary producers to the agribusiness and agri-food companies that create value-added products for Canadian and global markets.”\\n\\nLooking ahead, FCC has set its sights on advancing its public policy role by contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive agriculture and agri-food industry. The federal Crown corporation is launching initiatives to advance mental health awareness in agriculture, developing financing and business support for women entrepreneurs, and exploring ways to involve more indigenous people and communities in the industry.\\n\\n“By helping primary producers and agri-food operators achieve their full potential, FCC is enabling the industry to create more opportunities for a broader range of people who can bring fresh ideas and new energy to Canadian agriculture and agri-food,” Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay said. “At the same time, FCC is contributing to our government’s ambitious goal of increasing agri-food exports to $75 billion by 2025.”\\n\\nIn 2017-18, FCC support programs were provided last year for Ontario and Quebec customers impacted by excessive moisture and, more recently, New Brunswick and Quebec maple syrup producers and Maritimes fruit and vegetable producers impacted by unfavorable weather this spring.\\n\\nFCC also gave back almost $4 million through community investment initiatives, launched the Ignite summit for young farmers, offered a wide range of Ag Knowledge Exchange learning events attracting more than 15,000 participants and raised an equivalent of 7.2 million meals in conjunction with its like-minded partners through the FCC Drive Away Hunger tour in support of food banks across Canada. It also continues to support groups, such as 4-H Canada, Ag in the Classroom, the Canadian Agricultural Safety Association, STARS air ambulance service and numerous industry associations.\\n\\n“Our role goes well beyond loan transactions,” Hoffort said. “We look forward to continuing our support for young and new entrants, enabling intergenerational transfers of family farms and supporting the growth of our customers and the industry.”\\n\\nOther 2017-18 financial highlights include:\\n\\nNet income of $669.9 million, to be reinvested in agriculture through funding new loans and developing agriculture knowledge, products and services for customers.\\n\\nA dividend of $308.3 million paid by FCC to the Government of Canada.\\n\\nA healthy loan portfolio with the allowance for credit losses remaining steady, reflecting a strong and vibrant industry.\\n\\nStrong debt-to-equity and total capital ratios, indicating continued financial strength and an ongoing ability to serve the agriculture and agri-food industry.\\n\\nFCC continues to provide free learning opportunities and economic insights through events, web, social media and various publications for all involved with the industry.\\n\\nSource : FCC',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Alvaro Garcia\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough belonging to the family Bovidae (bison, cattle, sheep, etc.), and sharing some characteristics with their ruminant cousins, goats are unique. They are represented worldwide by two genus: Oreamnos and Capra. The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) resides in the American Northwest. The wild goat (Capra aegagrus) has a widespread distribution ranging from Europe and Asia Minor to Central Asia and the Middle East and is considered the ancestor of the domestic goat. Domestication of goats has been going on for thousands of years and it apparently started in the Persian Empire (today’s Iran), and Asia. Through centuries of selection the domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) resulted to date in 165 breeds (dairy and meat) recognized worldwide. One of their characteristics is that, similar to their ancestors, they have retained the ability to thrive in harsh environments; granted, modern breeds selected for high production will need more feed than under maintenance conditions. Goats are termed browsers because of their selective feeding habits, that is they like to choose. They are also extremely fond of leaves (shrubs and trees) and thus some also label them as folivores (“leaf eaters”). However, nothing is definite with goats; if they find a nice pasture they will graze particularly relishing prickly weeds that grow in it! If these characteristics were not enough to admire, goats are also very hardy when it comes to weather extremes. They originate from environments that are very hot during the day but can be freezing at night. If there is one thing goats particularly dislike however is to get wet! There is one other aspect besides their natural biological advantages, and that is their temperament. When walking in the field they will follow their owner to a different feeding station, and enjoy this interaction in the meantime.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Goats in the Upper Midwest?\\n\\nThe short introduction above helps better understand why we can successfully raise goats in this region. Their adaptability to different environmental conditions makes them an excellent choice for small acreages and or land where crops do not prosper without significant investments in equipment or soil amendments. To optimize productivity and profitability without taxing the environment there is an adage worth considering: “It makes more sense to adapt the genetics to the environment than to modify this one to accommodate certain genetics”. This goes for both plant and animal genetics. For centuries man has modified the land so species less adapted to it can prosper. This practice is becoming increasingly expensive and oftentimes detrimental to the environment. The map shows that west of the Missouri river the moisture storage capacity is low compared to the east. Even during years of normal rainfall there can be short-term dry spells that affect crops.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoil moisture storage capacity helps determine drought vulnerability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Soil moisture capacity is lower in areas with shallower soils and soils that contain high clay content. A lower soil moisture capacity limits the ability of the soil to store winter and early spring precipitations for use by crops during the summer growing months. The counties in this map are clipped to show cropland only. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using characteristics data from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Soil Survey Geographic Database, 2010.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the Great Plains have always been considered a semi-arid area of the U.S. This Region is characterized by hot, relatively short summers, and usually cold, dry winters. Annual precipitation increases by almost 70 percent between the Western (East of the Rockies) and Eastern ends of the Region. Potential moisture losses by evapotranspiration also increase by almost 400 percent between the Northern (Canadian border) and the Southern extremes. In addition to these moisture gradients, agricultural production is challenged by high climate variability interspersed with periods of severe precipitation shortages. Susceptibility to drought is not only determined by the yearly precipitation but also by the moisture storage capacity of the different types of soil.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoats however can easily adapt to the variable environmental and foraging conditions of this region with only minor management strategies in order to meet their requirements. Their foraging behavior will more than likely allow them to prosper in parts of the state while they take care of most of the weeds. Granted, there will be a need for mineral supplementation as well as some grain for higher producing animals. Similarly, if forage is extremely scarce or during the winter months, hay and grain supplementation will also be needed. Fresh clean water should always be available; goats have a very keen sense of smell and will reluctantly drink dirty or off-flavored water. Finally, and as far as “accommodations” go, just remember they need protection from the rain, wind, and potential predators (dogs, coyotes, etc.).\\n\\n\\n\\nChoosing the Right Goats\\n\\nThe most common dairy goat breeds registered with the American Dairy Goat Association are: Nubian, LaMancha, Alpine, Oberhasli, Toggenburg, Saanen, Sable, and Nigerian Dwarf. Choosing the right breed is more of a personal preference between milk volume, milk solids, better resistance to environmental conditions or just looks. Regardless of the decision, there are local farms that successfully keep any of these breeds in the Upper Midwest. This article is not meant to delve the advantage of each breed. It is worth noting however that Saanens are considered the “Holsteins” of the goat world because of their high milk production; Nubians and Nigerian Dwarfs on the other hand produce less milk, however much more concentrated in solids, particularly fat and protein. The remaining breeds productivity is somewhere between both extremes and varies on individual goats depending on their genetics and management. Granted, one could choose not to work with pure breeds but incorporating the desirable characteristics of two or more breeds through crossbreeding. The offspring of crosses between a breed characterized by high milk production (for example Saanen) with another with more milk solids, will usually result in animals that may produce less milk volume, but with more solids than the original Saanen. This first generation of animals will show what has been described as “hybrid vigor” with excellent production, breeding, and adaptability to their environment. Over time though, when they are crossed back to any of the two parental breeds it is difficult to maintain the positive traits of this first cross, and the productive advantages of the first crossbreds are slowly lost.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the decision of the breed has been made then it comes the search for the individual animals. An acceptable milk production is obviously the individual trait producers usually look for first. Since it is an inheritable trait transmitted by both parents to the doelings, it is important to verify milk records whenever possible. This does not mean that in absence of records one cannot choose animals based on their conformation and current milk production. When choosing virgin doe yearlings, it is highly recommendable to take a look at their dam and its overall conformation, particularly the udder. Udders should be adequately attached, look full when in lactation, both teats centered and of adequate size. Some does may develop disproportionally large (wide) teats, one or even both. This ends up becoming a problem when milking by hand and even with a milking machine. It is sometimes the result of kids being allowed to suckle, if they show preference for one teat over the other. A possible explanation of this preference is that a thinner teat canal in one teat that does not allow for an easy milk flow discourages the kid(s) to suckle that teat with milking accumulating in the teat cistern and progressively stretching it. Make sure kids suckle alternatively from both teats and if not, milk out the one that’s being refused. The other very important aspect is udder attachment. In lactating does udders should be adequately attached to the abdomen by strong ligaments. This is apparent in heavy producers and particularly from their second lactation on. Well-attached udders should be high, with both teat ends not surpassing a horizontal line drawn through the hocks. Extremely low udders can lead to udder or teat injuries which if deep enough can progress into fatal mastitis cases. The topline of the body should be straight (withers to rump) with some goats showing a slight slope from the withers to the rump. One other important aspect is to verify that the hoofs are trimmed regularly; badly trimmed or untrimmed hoofs can lead to painful lameness that will reduce feed intake and milk production.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf checking an adequate conformation is important, making sure the goats are free from a couple of critical diseases is crucial. If kept properly, goats are quite sturdy when it comes to ailments that may affect them. When purchasing the initial stock however, one needs to be fairly strict with a couple of diseases that they may bring with them: Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis (or CAE) and Caseous lymphadenitis (CL). The first one is viral in nature, it is specific to goats, and it is transmitted to each other via infected colostrum, milk, or blood. Symptoms are not apparent in goats except for five clinical presentations including arthritis (the most common, and usually observed after 6 months of age), encephalitis, interstitial pneumonia, mastitis, and progressive weight loss. Goats may show joint stiffness, shifting leg lameness, decreased ambulation, weight loss, reluctance to rise, and abnormal posture. Acute swelling of the joint is also possible which may lead to arthritis. The encephalitic (brain) form of CAE affects kids 2 to 6 months of age, which show signs of incoordination and inappropriate placement of limbs while walking which can progressively develop into paralysis. The interstitial pneumonia is characterized by chronic cough, labored breathing, and weight loss. In adult does mastitis can be observed usually around kidding time; it is characterized by a firm udder with difficult or no milk ejection. It is a sound practice to ask for negative CAE blood analysis tests before purchasing goats. The second disease or Caseous Lymphadenitis (CL), also called pseudotuberculosis, or just “abscesses”, is a chronic contagious disease affecting sheep and goats. It is bacterial in nature (Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis) characterized by swelling, rupture, and pus draining from affected peripheral subcutaneous lymph nodes. It can be detected by palpating enlarged lymph nodes under the skin in the angle of the mandible, right at the base of the neck and before the scapula (shoulder blade), right before the femur & tibia joint (stifle joint), and supra-mammary (above the udder) right behind the rear legs. This bacterium can survive in the environment for a minimum of one year, and it is usually spread through cuts during shearing, fences, and feeders. This disease has the potential to be transferred to humans (zoonosis) so affected animals and their lesions should be handled with surgical gloves. Treatment involves draining the pus from the abscesses and using a 7% iodine solution to flush them. Of course there are other ailments that can affect goats and that can be treated by their owner if minor or that may need veterinary attention. The two described above however, are in my opinion, the two most important to start a goat herd with the right foot.\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging the Herd\\n\\nOnce the right location, breed, and animals are identified, it is time to think about how to manage the herd. Since this is about small-scale let’s assume 10 lactating does.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s suppose we have decided to buy 10 alpines with an adult body weight of roughly 140 pounds each. Depending on the standing forage available, this number of animals can easily be kept in 1-2 acres of foraging area. Granted, one could have more animals (or less surface area) if they are supplemented with forage and grain. The author has kept up to 20 goats in a little less than one acre with the caveat that it was a spot with very lush forage growth with plenty of brome, reed canary grass, and other palatable forbs. There were also plenty of weeds; at least initially, since the goats gradually took care of most of them! Goats are grazed in this unfenced pasture under supervision, since the neighbor rotated corn and beans and goats were fond of both!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Live cyanobacterial blooms can be green, but also red or yellow, and often turn blue after the bloom dies and dries on the surface or shoreline.”\\n\\nSome species of cyanobacteria can be toxic when livestock and wildlife ingest them. Toxicity is dependent on the species consuming the water, the concentration of the toxin or toxins and the amount of water ingested.\\n\\nCyanobacteria can produce neuro and liver toxins. Signs of neurotoxin poisoning can appear within five minutes to up to several hours after ingestion. In animals, symptoms include weakness, staggering, muscle tremors, difficulty in breathing, convulsions and, ultimately, death.\\n\\nAnimals affected by liver toxins may exhibit weakness, pale-colored mucous membranes, mental derangement, bloody diarrhea and, ultimately, death. Typically, livestock are found dead before producers observe symptoms. If cyanobacterial poisoning is suspected as the cause of death, producers should check the edges of ponds for dead wildlife.\\n\\nWhen collecting a water sample, follow NDSU Extension’s Livestock Water Testing Guidelines ( https://tinyurl.com/NDSU-LivestockWaterTesting ).\\n\\n“Be sure to wear gloves, as cyanobacteria can be toxic to humans,” advises Michelle Mostrom, NDSU veterinary toxicologist. “Collect a sample of the suspected cyanobacterial bloom from the surface of the water and deeper in the water. The sample should be kept cool but not frozen, and submit it to the NDSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory or a commercial laboratory.\\n\\n“The sample can be evaluated microscopically for algae, or the water can be analyzed for several of the toxins at commercial labs at a higher cost,” she adds.\\n\\nFor more information on sample collection and submission, contact your local NDSU Extension agent.\\n\\nHere are some ways producers can prevent cyanobacterial poisoning of livestock:',\n",

Many producers equate baling hay with hot summer days and a rush to beat the weather. While getting the hay baled and off the field is understandably a priority, doing the job safely should remain top of mind.\\n\\n“To increase the safety of baling procedures while ensuring the job gets done, look for hazards related to baler operation, handling, transporting and stacking,” says Kenda Lubeck, farm safety awareness coordinator with Alberta Agriculture and Forestry.\\n\\n“Once you identify hazards, make the necessary changes to ensure the safety of all workers.”\\n\\nThe following are some of the hazards.\\n\\nHandling:\\n\\nEnsure no children play near hay balers, carriers, and stackers.\\n\\nProperly train workers operating tractors, front-end loaders or forklifts.\\n\\nTractors with cabs, FOPS (falling object protective structure) or four-poster ROPS (roll-over protective structure) used to lift round bales are essential.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Geoff Geddes, for Swine Innovation Porc\\n\\nUntil they grow opposable thumbs and get milk from the fridge like the rest of us, piglets rely on sows for their daily supply. And just as kids are told to drink their milk so they’ll grow up big and strong, consumption early in life is essential to piglet development. That was the impetus for the project “Maximizing mammary development”, part of a series of studies aimed at improving sow milk yield and piglet growth.\\n\\n“We know that if we take a baby pig and feed it milk through a bottle in addition to what the sow gives it, the pig grows more,” said Dr. Chantal Farmer, Research Scientist -Swine Lactation Biology with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. “That tells us the sow is limiting piglet growth rate by not producing enough milk.”\\n\\nMammary lapse\\n\\nAs well, the move towards hyperprolific sows increased litter size without sufficiently boosting the sow’s milk yield, resulting in less milk per piglet than ten years ago.\\n\\n“That’s where I come in, as I want to increase the amount of milk a sow produces. My focus over the past 15 years has been mammary development since the more mammary cells you have, the more milk you can synthesize.”\\n\\nTiming is everything\\n\\nThe two key periods for mammary development are from 3 months to puberty and the last third of gestation. While Dr. Farmer has studied a number of factors affecting that development, her focus for this project was sow body condition.\\n\\n“It has been shown that if a sow at the end of gestation has 36 mm of backfat, she will produce less milk than a sow with 25 mm of backfat. But that information is useless for producers as nobody has animals that obese.”\\n\\nConsequently, there was really no helpful advice for producers regarding body condition and milk production until this study.\\n\\nBring backfat to the forefront\\n\\n“To make the research more relevant, I looked at sows that better represent what you see on-farm. Starting with animals having similar backfat levels at mating, we gave them three different amounts of feed in gestation and compared their mammary development.”\\n\\nThe results were both interesting to producers and surprising for researchers.\\n\\n“I thought 25-26 mm of back fat would have a negative impact on mammary development, but that didn’t happen. It was actually the sows between 12-15 mm that showed poor mammary development, while animals in the 16 -26 mm range were just fine.”\\n\\nFor producers, these results can impact their gilt feeding programs.\\n\\n“When you have a gilt in its first gestation, you must be sure to feed it enough. The current practice is to limit feed intake in that period, but this study shows you must look at body condition and perhaps go slowly on the restriction if necessary. Though a lot of feed companies will give you restrictions based on weight and backfat, they didn’t have exact target numbers until now. Thanks to our findings, nutritionists and producers know that 16 mm is the lower limit for backfat in a Yorkshire x Landrace cross.”\\n\\nMost importantly, industry is now aware that feeding level in gestation is critical to achieve optimal mammary development in late gestation and to maximize future potential milk yield. Armed with that knowledge, producers can refine their feeding programs and help set the sow up for future success.\\n\\n“A few years back, a growing gilt was fed the same way as a growing pig. Yet, the growing pig will get eaten while the growing gilt will have babies that need milk. They shouldn’t be treated the same, and it’s great that nutritionists will have a better idea of how to feed new gilts. It’s just one aspect of production, yet it’s something that industry can take and use right away.”\\n\\nSource : Swine Innovation Porc',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Geoff Geddes, for Swine Innovation Porc\\n\\nWalking on a slatted floor all day with cloven hooves might sound easy enough…until you try it. Navigating the gaps in concrete flooring can be treacherous for pigs, while dealing with knowledge gaps on proper slat width is a challenge for producers. Filling that information void is a priority, especially in light of the revised Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Pigs. And if it matters to industry, it matters to researchers.\\n\\n“Flooring is one of the big topics these days as it’s associated with a number of foot and leg problems for sows,” said Dr. Laurie Connor, Professor, Department of Animal Science in the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences at the University of Manitoba. “Lameness is the second most common reason for culling, and it’s an even greater issue in group housing where animals must move around a lot to get feed, access certain resources and maintain their position in the social hierarchy.”\\n\\nThe wrong flooring configuration can cause problems with lying and walking comfort, hoof injuries, and resulting distress and pain. Because that can lead to sub-optimal performance, it’s also a pain in the producer’s pocketbook, which makes the lack of well-validated guidelines for slat and gap width especially troubling.\\n\\nSeeking concrete results\\n\\n“We know slatted floors are problematic, but they’re needed for manure removal. Given that reality, our objective for this project was to determine the most effective slat and gap widths for concrete flooring in group housing that would balance sow comfort, manure management and general air quality.”\\n\\nUsing video and kinematics (the branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects), researchers tested the way 12 young, non-lame sows and 12 larger, lame sows walked on three different slat and gap widths.\\n\\n“We found that a slat width of 105 mm (about 4 inches) and a gap width of 19 mm (.75 inches) had the least impact on the animals’ normal gait or movement, especially in the smaller sows.”\\n\\nThen it was time to test those results in the barn using two sets of young, pregnant gilts during two gestations. One group was housed on the widths mentioned above, while the control group used slats of 125 mm and gaps of 25 mm, which are common dimensions in the industry.\\n\\nGait keepers\\n\\n“We did a lot of detailed observations including gait scores at the beginning, middle and end of pregnancy. We compared the condition of the feet when they went in, and at the end when they came off the flooring, and also looked at weight distribution on each limb at these two points. Combining all of this information gave us a good idea of what was going on.”\\n\\nThey also looked at a number of other factors including body weight and back fat changes, reproductive performance, air quality and cleanliness of the pens. In an industry that’s always pushing for larger litters and heavier pigs, researchers concluded that when it comes to slats and gaps, “less is more”.\\n\\n“Pigs on the narrower slats and gaps appeared to be more comfortable and had fewer feet sole lesions and wall cracks. There was no difference in air quality or cleanliness between the two groups, and the slightly narrower slats may actually increase the chance of manure going through, so that’s a bonus.”\\n\\nGoing forward, Dr. Connor said this doesn’t offer enough evidence for people to “rip up floors and put in new ones”; however, it does suggest that those doing conversions or new builds would be wise to opt for the narrower slats and gaps.\\n\\nIt means a change in thinking for producers, but it could be a change for the better. And, who knows, they might just be floored by the results.\\n\\nSource : University of Manitoba',\n",

The fellowship requires students to pursue coursework and research in the livestock and meat marketing areas.\\n\\n“Land-grant universities have provided valuable educational services to pork producers for over 100 years,” said Dr. Steve Meyer, economist for Kerns and Associates. “I believe that making livestock marketing coursework and research more attractive will draw more students to the diminishing field of study.”\\n\\nThe guidelines and application form for the fellowship application can be found at https://library.pork.org/l/2408f6fb0ca9e94a/. All submission materials must be received at the National Pork Board, Attention Bill Winkelman, 1776 NW 114th St., Clive, IA 50325, by August 8, 2018. Following review and selection, the recipient will be notified by Aug. 29, 2018.\\n\\n“These professionals conduct important work by providing consultation and guiding pork producers in key decision making,” said Steve Rommereim, National Pork Board president and producer from Alcester, South Dakota. “When Dr. Meyer presented this opportunity to the Pork Checkoff Board of Directors, we all agreed just how important developing the next generation of leaders is to our industry.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Kassidy Buse\\n\\nWith its drought, low soil pH, and high stocking density tolerance, tall fescue is the forage of choice in many pastures. While it may come off as a “super grass,” tall fescue can cause major health and reproductive issues in some animals.\\n\\nDanielle Smarsh, equine extension specialist at Pennsylvania State University, addressed tall fescue toxicity in pregnant broodmares in a recent article published in Penn State’s Field Crop News.\\n\\n“Certain varieties of tall fescue are infected with the fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum,” explains Smarsh. While this fungus is great for the plant since it protects against drought and some insects, it isn’t so great for grazing animals.\\n\\nThe fungus produces ergot alkaloids, which have harmful physiological effects in grazing animals, including pregnant broodmares.\\n\\nFescue toxicosis is a major risk if pregnant broodmares consume infected tall-fescue. Some of the many symptoms of fescue toxicosis include abortions, stillbirths, and weak foals.\\n\\nLate-pregnancy broodmares are the only horses that have ill effects from grazing infected tall fescue. Research demonstrates that stallions grazing infected tall fescue show no signs of declining reproductive performance.\\n\\nThe exact amount of ergot on a given pasture varies depending on the time of year, the amount of fertilizer present, and plant variation.\\n\\nThe real kicker is that you can’t tell if tall fescue is infected or not just by looking at it; the grass has to be tested.\\n\\nTake tall fescue samples in early summer and fall when grass is growing rapidly. The exact time to sample is highly dependent upon weather and region.\\n\\nWhat can be done to mitigate the issue with pregnant broodmares?\\n\\nIf pastures test positive for endophyte-infected tall fescue, remove pregnant broodmares 60 to 90 days before foaling. Another option is to treat mares with domperidone to relieve most toxicosis symptoms. Consult with your veterinarian before taking this approach.\\n\\nIf enough space, time, and money is available, renovating pastures to remove the infected tall fescue is a possible option. Tall fescue can be removed with an herbicide and replaced with other cool-season grasses or endophyte-free tall fescue.\\n\\n“This process can be costly and take several years, so it might not be the best solution for everyone,” Smarsh warns. She also notes that it is difficult to remove all infected tall fescue.\\n\\nIf a mix of cool-season grasses is used, identify the percentage of tall fescue in the stand. If the percent of tall fescue is small, there is less risk for broodmares to contract toxicosis. Even so, the best management option is to remove them 60 to 90 days before foaling.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nancy S. Loving\\n\\n\\n\\nThings to consider and questions to ask\\n\\nChoosing where to board your horse can be a very personal decision based on your riding pursuit, pocketbook, and other preferences. Boarding operations come in all sizes, ranging from high-end stables with 50-plus equine inhabitants to the backyard barn with just a few clients. Some places specialize in housing horses engaged in a particular discipline, while others accept horses of all types and talents. And features that are important to some horse owners are not important to others. For this reason, arm yourself with a checklist when going to evaluate potential facilities so you can select a barn that best meets your needs.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst consider a farm’s proximity to where you live, its monthly cost, and whether you desire access to a trainer, indoor arena, and other amenities. Jenny Baldwin is an international FEI dressage competitor and certified Swedish instructor who has earned the title of Grand Prix Champion for the United States Dressage Federation Region 5 and the Rocky Mountain Dressage Society for four consecutive years. She has generally boarded at large facilities because, as a trainer, this gives her access to horse owner clientele. Also, her clients’ horses and her own require immaculate care as top-tier competitors, so there are several features she finds relevant in large stables.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople and Policies\\n\\nWhen searching for a large boarding stable, Baldwin suggests selecting a property owned by someone who is a rider and/or is involved with horses in some manner. “Otherwise,” she says, “shortcuts might be taken if the person is not familiar with horses or sensitive to the needs of horses and horse owners.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn her experience, good barn managers are hard to find and even harder to keep, and so the stable owner should be an integral part of managing the horses’ care.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany boarding facilities have rules, which Baldwin feels are good as long as there aren’t too many restrictions, which can become frustrating and burdensome. Good rules are easy to understand and implement, such as: Be courteous to everyone at the barn; clean up after yourself; and honor an arena schedule for riders and instructors. Rules that are too strict, especially related to arena use and hours of access, tend to limit a rider’s activities or enjoyment at a facility.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvid endurance rider Dana Cernak agrees that rules are important as long as they aren’t too taxing. Cernak boarded her horse for many years but currently runs her own home-based boarding facility in Longmont, Colorado. At her farm, for instance, it is simple courtesy to respect quiet hours, when boarders are not permitted at the barn, between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.\\n\\n\\n\\nCernak insists anyone coming onto the property sign a liability release; this applies to not just the horse owner but also his or her friends and relatives. She sends out boarding contracts in advance of the horse moving to the property so there is no misunderstanding of the boarder’s expectations for what she will provide. Contracts include information ranging from day the boarding bill is due to what services the farm will provide. It also allows for how the contract will end; for instance, a written 30-day notice to vacate the facility is fairly standard. As a potential boarder, this is important so you can decide if you are willing to comply with the facility’s policies before signing the contract and moving your horse to the property.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmenities and Approaches\\n\\nBaldwin stresses the importance of clean water and quality hay and feed as primary features she looks for in a boarding stable. Hay should be clean and fresh and not riddled with mold or dust. Preferably, horses receive hay three or even four times a day in addition to turnout.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of turnout, ask how much the farm provides for each horse. How much turnout you want depends in part on whether you are boarding a frisky show horse that could hurt himself in a large field or a youngster that needs a sizable area to exercise, says Baldwin. What is the material and state of perimeter fencing? And is the turnout solo in small paddocks or with a herd in a spacious field? Baldwin recommends selecting turnout options appropriate for the horse and its temperament as well as your riding goals.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, stall size depends on whether you are boarding a Warmblood or an Arabian. All horses need a minimum 12-by-12-foot stall, but a larger horse needs more space to stretch out while lying down without danger of getting cast. Regardless of stall size, look for hazards such as sharp protrusions and stall doors that don’t meet flush with the floor or bottom rail, if it’s a sliding door, when surveying a stable.\\n\\n\\n\\nSafety is of paramount importance for anyone looking at a boarding facility. In most higher-end stables, the fences, stall doors, and the facility in general are already safe, says Baldwin. Nonetheless, examine the details, especially in older facilities that have endured years of wear and tear.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving specific areas for washing, grooming, and farrier and veterinary work are important for not just convenience but also safety.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother feature Baldwin takes note of is the footing in both indoor and outdoor arenas and how well it is maintained. Without good footing, horses can incur limb injury from repetitive concussion during training.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany horse owners these days are well aware of biosecurity practices that help mitigate the risk of infectious disease spread at a facility. At the very least, ask if the facility requires a health certificate and negative Coggins test for horses arriving to the premises—both for visiting horses and resident horses. Find out if the boarding facility has a closed or open system (i.e., do they allow riders to trailer in outside horses for lessons or friends to trailer in for a ride with you?). To protect boarders’ horses, some facilities don’t allow trailering in of nonresident horses other than for special events.\\n\\n\\n\\nAtmosphere and Expectations\\n\\nBaldwin also assesses a facility’s general atmosphere. Are the people there happy? Is there a positive feeling at the barn, or is there a negative overcast?\\n\\n\\n\\n“You may want to visit the barn on different occasions and at different times,” says Baldwin. It also helps to talk to the boarders to gather their impressions of how well their horse is faring at the facility and how happy they are with the care. Another consideration is how handlers treat the horses. In addition, is there rapid turnover of barn help? Are the facility’s staff members pleasant, and do they seem to enjoy their work?\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReminder from the State Veterinarian: with 2018’s Strong Mosquito Season, Horse Owners Need to Vaccinate Most Horses Now against Mosquito-borne Diseases\\n\\nMosquito season 2018 is a strong one, one of the worst in years. The deluge of rain has created stagnant pools of water perfect for mosquito breeding while cooler temperatures have helped to slow the maturation of larvae, delaying the pests’ season this year. “Now it has hit in full force, and horses are at risk of contracting mosquito-borne diseases such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile Virus (WNV),” said Dr. Charles Broaddus, State Veterinarian with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS).\\n\\nThe mortality rate with WNV is 30 percent, but up to 90 percent with EEE. There is no proven cure for these diseases, but veterinarians can provide supportive therapy.\\n\\nVDACS recommends that horse owners check with their veterinarians and if she or he recommends vaccination, the time to do it is now. “Both the WNV and EEE vaccine are highly effective in minimizing disease, if given appropriately,” said Dr. Broaddus. The vaccines are effective for 6-12 months, so most owners revaccinate at least annually and in areas where the disease occurs frequently, every six months. For the vaccine to be effective, it must be given at least two weeks before the horse is exposed to the virus. To stimulate full immunity, horses must be vaccinated twice, about 30 days apart, the first year of vaccination.\\n\\nOther prevention methods include dumping or draining standing water breeding sites (containers and puddles) for mosquitoes, using insect repellents and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn, and turning off the lights in and around the barn at night.\\n\\nHumans cannot become infected with EEE or WNV by handling an infected horse, nor can a horse acquire the virus directly from another infected horse. The presence of an infected horse in the area indicates that mosquitoes carrying the EEE or WNV viruses are present, however, and those insects pose a threat to both humans and horses.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Clair Thunes\\n\\n\\n\\nMy horses live with beef cattle. Our pastures are very poor and we are feeding hay, but all the stock is losing weight and I think I need to supplement them with some other feed. My feed store sells several all-purpose feeds which claim to be appropriate to feed both the horses and cattle. Are these really okay to feed to horses?\\n\\n\\n\\nA. The short answer to your question is that all-purpose feeds are at best “okay.” Not optimal, but probably okay. This assumes that they’re really designed and safe for both species.\\n\\n\\n\\nIonophore Toxicity in Horses\\n\\nI would never give horses feed made solely for ruminant species. The reason? Cattle feeds have the great potential of containing some type of ionophore (an antibiotic used in ruminant feed that is toxic to horses).\\n\\n\\n\\nMost feed manufacturers are aware of these risks and clean the lines between feeds containing ionophores and those designed for horses. Some not only they clean the lines but will run feed for other less sensitive species between a medicated feed run and feed made for horses. Of course some mills are more careful than others. In feeds sold as suitable for both cattle and horses there could still be that risk; in fact the risk exists in some feeds made solely for horses too, but hopefully manufacturers have taken care to remove possible sources of contamination before feed is milled for horses.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a perfect situation all feeds fed to horses are milled through dedicated equine lines that never come in to contact with feed containing ionophores and other potentially harmful medications.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutritional Deficiencies\\n\\nAssuming this mixed-use feed is ionophore free there are other factors that make it a less-than-optimal choice for horses. Cattle have a lower requirement for quality protein in their ration because they can utilize microbial protein. This is because in their digestive tracts, the source of microbial fermentation, precedes the site of protein absorption. In the horse the main site of protein digestion and absorption (the small intestine) occurs before the cecum and colon where the massive population of fiber utilizing microbes live. Horses, therefore, have a limited ability to utilize microbes as a source of protein unless they eat their feces. For this reason the dietary protein provided in an equine ration must be of better quality than that fed to ruminants such as cattle.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost all-purpose stock feeds contain 10-12% crude protein. This isn’t an inappropriate amount of protein for most mature horses; most dedicated equine feeds provide a similar amount of crude protein but also guarantee lysine and methionine amounts. These are essential amino acids that the horse is unable to make and they must, therefore, be in the diet. Cattle and other ruminants can rely on their microbial protein as a source of these key amino acids, but for horses need them in the diet. Inadequate amounts of lysine and methionine have implications for coat and hoof quality as well as muscle production, immune function, hormone production, digestive enzymes, and many other processes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother key difference between all-purpose stock feeds and dedicated equine feeds is the level of mineral fortification. A good number of equine-specific feeds for horses at maintenance have higher mineral inclusion levels than those in general-purpose stock feeds. For example, the copper and zinc levels in an equine feed for adult horses at maintenance are around 40 parts per million (ppm) and 120 ppm respectively versus only 10 ppm and 50 ppm in a general stock feed. The level of copper will be particularly low if the feed is also for use in sheep as copper is toxic to sheep. In this case copper might be as low as 5 ppm.\\n\\n\\n\\nVitamin levels in all-purpose feeds might also be low, especially for vitamin E. Horses require more vitamin E as work increases due to the oxidation products generated in muscle tissue. Obviously this type of work is not a concern for cattle, and an all-stock feed may only provide 20 international units (IU) per pound versus the maintenance feed for adult horses that provides 80 IU of vitamin E per pound. For working horses the level of vitamin E will be higher, possibly upwards of 100 IU per pound.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Auburn University equine veterinarian is having success treating horses with chronic pain and other conditions by using a form of integrative medicine: acupuncture.\\n\\n\\n\\nKara Lascola, DVM, MS, Dipl. ACVIM (LA), CVA, an associate professor of equine internal medicine in the Auburn University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Department of Clinical Sciences, in Alabama, says acupuncture, a key component of traditional Chinese medicine, has been used in humans for over a thousand years.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In veterinary medicine, it has become more widespread in just the last 10 to 15 years,” she said. “While it is probably used more commonly on dogs, I routinely use acupuncture on horses for pain management associated with musculoskeletal conditions—such as arthritis—and for treating neuropathies.”\\n\\n\\n\\nVeterinarians must be trained and certified to practice acupuncture, and Auburn currently has small and large animal veterinary faculty certified to practice this technique.\\n\\n\\n\\n“For me and some of my colleagues,” Lascola said, “our interest in acupuncture stemmed from frustration with the limited options available for treating pain in horses, particularly pain associated with chronic conditions.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are different approaches to explain how acupuncture works.\\n\\n\\n\\n“According to traditional Chinese medicine, there are pathways in the body along which energy flows,” Lascola said. “As a very simplified explanation, illness results in imbalances of this flow of energy. Inserting needles into acupuncture points—which are located on or near these pathways—is believed to correct these imbalances in energy flow. The choice of which acupuncture points to use depends on the underlying problem as well as a variety of patient factors.”\\n\\n\\n\\nLascola says acupuncture can be an effective treatment method for a variety of conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It has even been shown that acupuncture stimulates the body’s own release of endorphins, which are natural pain killing hormones,” she said. “Acupuncture also seems to stimulate circulation and may increase the pain threshold.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIndividual animals respond differently to acupuncture therapy, and Lascola says lasting results involve a series of treatments that are typically tailored to meet the needs of the individual patient.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is important to remember that acupuncture is not just a one-time treatment that produces long-term results,” she said. “Treatment involves a series of sessions to be effective.”\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Rebecca Gimenez\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you live in an area at risk for wildfires? If so, it’s time to take steps to help minimize wildfire’s impact on your horses. Take heed even if your area hasn’t seen a wildfire for 15 years or longer; the El Nino weather patterns could increase the chance of dry conditions and, thus, fires in areas that haven’t been impacted in many years.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not necessarily a wildfire’s flames that will initially force your and your horses’ evacuation. Rather, it’s the thick black smoke filled with toxins, along with poor air quality, that will begin having an impact well before the flames arrive. Horses have large lungs and no way to filter out smoke and fire’s toxic byproducts—including acrid smoke and tiny particles—and can develop serious health issues even when smoke is several miles away.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo help you prepare in advance, we’ll review some simple steps you can take to make farms as safe and evacuations as seamless as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign or retrofit your barn with wildfire and fire safety in mind. Open ventilation, frost-free hydrants, dry hydrant connections to existing water sources, and 33 yards minimum of defensible space around each structure allows fire crews to rally around your facility to protect it from falling cinders and direct flames. During fires, consider generators or solar power sources to run pumps and appliances after power goes out. Ensure you have stored extra water for animals in case power is lost and hydrants aren’t functional.\\n\\n\\n\\nSteel and tile roofs are better able to resist flame spread from cinders compared to composite roofs which are more vulnerable.\\n\\n\\n\\nCinders often instigate a fire from the ground floor, which is generally where flammable materials including hay, straw, and bedding are stored or located. Further, many barns cannot be fully enclosed with a flame-retardant material, which could prevent cinders blowing into the recesses of stalls and storage areas.\\n\\n\\n\\nUse xeric landscaping to reduce flammable vegetation around structures. If the flames are so close that they threaten barns, wind-blown cinders could cause facilities to catch fire before the flame front actually gets to the property. Cinders can be blown in from hundreds of yards or even miles away. Consider FireWise plants for landscaping; your local extension service can provide a list of these species. There are no completely fireproof plants but some catch and spread fire more slowly and, therefore, are safer for fire-prone areas. Avoid landscaping with mulches made of combustibles and placing plants too close to buildings, as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nMake evacuation plans. Evacuation planning should be a part of the owner’s annual review of a facility’s disaster mitigation strategies. Owners leading horses down streets or interstate evacuation routes is a poor method for removing horses from harm’s way. While it demonstrates the lengths to which people will go to attempt to save their animals, it is dangerous and a consequence of failing to plan ahead. Rather, keep trucks fueled and trailers hitched with everything loaded and ready to go should evacuation warnings or notices come in.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe sure to pack water and forage for any equids being evacuated and ensure each animal has proper identification, especially if being housed at a public shelter or private facility.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery few items of horse clothing are fire retardant, but there are still some materials to stay away from during a fire. Avoid synthetic (e.g., nylon or plastic) halters, lead ropes, and tack, along with nylon fly sheets and masks, that could melt and cause serious burns to the horse or the handler.\\n\\nTeaching horses to be reliable loaders in trailers, vans, or transportation equipment is essential to facilitating evacuations.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t just lead your horse out of a barn and say, “Now what am I going to do?” Have evacuation sites in mind ahead of time, ranging from facilities close by to ones much farther away, if need be.\\n\\n\\n\\nPractice your evacuation plan to find its weaknesses, and coordinate with local fire officials to get their input. They are the professionals that can point out individual problems to consider with fire prevention. Your local fire department and even insurers can walk through facilities and barns with owners to identify hazards and give suggestions for reducing fire risk. Large public riding and show facilities are normally inspected at least annually, but regular inspections are a good idea regardless of an operation’s size or local law enforcement requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate and post a barn fire evacuation plan and practice it routinely—at least once per quarter. Public facilities and boarding barns should host fire drills and review the evacuation plans monthly to ensure new and long-time boarders, employees, and students alike are well prepared.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, facilities should post wildfire evacuation plans where everyone can see it easily. The planning process is as important as (if not more important than) the plan itself. The plan should involve all potentially affected people—family, employees, friends, boarders, etc.—to ensure everyone’s commitment to the effort. This kind of training and preparation makes employees and family members more self-reliant, efficient and confident if a disaster or emergency occurs.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince it is impossible to render any facility fire-proof, management must enforce fire prevention techniques and and train employees in mitigation techniques. Wildfires require a large number of local (even regional, state, and national) firefighters to deploy, which means they might not be available to assist you until late in the disaster’s course. Untrained people without respiratory protection and proper fire protective clothing and training should never enter burning or smoking barn structures or zones. All personnel commonly around barns should be familiar with the evacuation plan and the location of barn fire response equipment such as emergency phones, hoses, water sources and fire extinguishers.\\n\\n\\n\\nFacilities should have a shelter-in-place plan for animals and humans if evacuation is not an option or there isn’t time to safely do so. Horses should not be left in barns during wildfires. Rather, turn them out in pastures or paddocks with all combustible vegetation removed (such as drylots), plowed under, or previously burned off. Shelter-in-place is considered very dangerous and should only be used where there is not time to evacuate the animals to a safer place.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Caroline N. Niederman\\n\\n\\n\\nHorse’s teeth do not grow continually. Rather, they “erupt” and wear over time. By the time a horse reaches his late teens and early 20s, normal age-related changes are occurring within the chewing surfaces of his cheek teeth that cause progressive loss of surface area. Owners need to make dietary changes for their older horses in light of this, and watch for common dental issues seen in this aging population.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chewing and grinding surfaces of horses’ cheek teeth are rough, due to folds of very hard enamel. They also contain cementum and dentin that surround and fill in the crevices within the enamel folds, respectively. Cementum and dentin are softer than enamel, so they are not useful for grinding feed, especially hay. As a horse ages and wears down his teeth, they get shorter and shorter and their rate of eruption slows.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as he enters his teens, and certainly by the time he reaches his 20s, the rate of eruption has diminished to the point that new enamel is no longer surfacing to replace the existing enamel. So, these folds begin to wear. The center of each tooth becomes smooth, reducing the horse’s effective chewing surface area. The exposed dentin and cementum continue to wear, eventually causing the tooth to wear down to the gum line. An outer rim of enamel sometimes remains.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

It’s a kind of nondescript sensation that says, “Something’s not right.” It might be that clop-clop-clop-CLOP. Or an ever-so-slightly higher tension in the reins every second step. Maybe it’s how you keep having to shift the saddle upright. Or, maybe it’s something deeper, something in your gut, telling you something’s simply off.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever the sensation, it’s about to make you utter that dreaded four-letter word to the rider nearby: “Does my horse look lame?”\\n\\n\\n\\nTo help you better understand what kinds of clues to feel, watch, and listen for when you’re riding, we’ve gotten help from veterinarians well-versed in equine biomechanics. They take the non out of nondescript when describing these 10 under-saddle lameness signs. Here we’ll show you how to fine-tune your riding senses— particularly your eyes, ears, seat, hand, and balance—to recognize lameness when you’re on your horse. That way you can seek diagnosis and treatment, which will help you get back in that saddle as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Your horse bobs his head more on one footstep than the other.\\n\\nThe brightest red flag that your mount is lame—short of him actually hopping or becoming three-legged—is the uneven head bob. When the head drops lower during one step than another, you can be sure there’s a lame limb somewhere. Usually that leg is in the front, and it will actually be the one opposite to the foot he’s stepping on when his head bobs.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you don’t see it in the head from where you’re sitting, you might notice it in the shoulder, says Laura Werner, DVM, MS, Dipl. ACVS, an associate at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute, in Lexington, Kentucky. “They’ll seem shorter-strided or heavier in one shoulder than the other,” she says.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour riding style might influence that bob and short stride, however, says Marie Rhodin, PhD, associate professor in equine clinical biomechanics at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, in Uppsala. “Riding in a short rein can mask these signs” in a mildly lame horse, she says. “This actually happens fairly frequently with experienced riders who don’t even realize they’re doing it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen riding the horse forward, with short reins, and in a frame is the rider inadvertently balances the horse’s movement with the aids and keeps his head fairly steady.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut with a sensitive hand, riders can pick up on it, says Sue Dyson, MA, VetMB, PhD, DEO, Dipl. ECVSMR, FRCVS, head of Clinical Orthopaedics at the Animal Health Trust Centre for Equine Studies, in Newmarket, England. “I would ask them, ‘Have you got an even contact in each rein?’ If they haven’t, there’s probably a reason for that, and it probably reflects underlying pain,” she says.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you aren’t entirely sure your horse’s head is bobbing, try dropping the reins and putting him on a 10- to 20-meter circle, our sources say. Circling should exacerbate the symptoms. And the loose reins will allow the horse the freedom to bob his head and shorten his stride to express his pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Your horse is making dragging or uneven hoofbeat sounds.\\n\\nA hard, flat surface such as a road is particularly useful for amplifying hoof-fall noises—even better if you ride next to a wall that bounces sounds back up to your ears.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ll hear the horse hitting more heavily on one foot (the healthy one) than the other, especially if it’s front-limb lameness,” Werner says. “If it’s hind-limb lameness, you’re more likely to hear a dragging sound.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don’t just hear dragging; you might also notice its effects. “You might see that one back toe is worn,” she says. “Or one back leg might be more covered in dust or mud than the other.”\\n\\n\\n\\nLike head-bobbing, however, these signs probably won’t appear with subtle forms of lameness, Dyson says.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Your horse has issues turning one direction.\\n\\nChanging direction can be a real turning point for detecting lameness, and not just during veterinary lameness exams. Even from the saddle, you can pick up signs of lameness when you notice your horse has difficulty making turns or performing lateral movements.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Turning, and especially circling, is going to exacerbate the expression of lameness in most cases,” Rhodin says.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe signs can be obvious: marked asymmetric movement, head-bobbing, and a shortened stride when turning. Or it could be quite subtle, with very light resistance to turning. “You might just feel a certain unevenness in a step, when turning a corner or turning onto the center line (as in dressage), but otherwise the horse feels normal,” Dyson says.\\n\\n\\n\\nReining horses might be challenging to spin in one direction or the other. Barrel horses might have difficulty rounding barrels in a single direction. And dressage horses might suddenly have more difficulty with half-pass to the right or the left, she says, referring to the lateral movement in which the horse moves forward and sideways simultaneously, bent in the direction of travel.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore you assume it’s just a “sidedness” problem, consider the more likely possibility that it’s lameness. “In a well-trained horse, you should not notice much of a difference from one side to another,” Dyson says. “In an untrained horse, you might. But significant differences from right to left normally signify an underlying problem.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRiding the horse in different-diameter circles could reveal more obvious signs of lameness.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You might have a horse do well in a 20-meter circle, but when you ask him to do a 10-meter circle, he changes rhythm or changes his outline, or he starts to toe-drag or to lean in,” Dyson says. “There’s something about the 10-meter circle—not the 12-meter but truly the 10-meter—that horses seem to find more difficult.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHow the rising trot feels on a circle can be especially telling. A lame hind limb might feel like a “flat tire,” says Werner. And the posting motion can feel generally uncomfortable in a particular direction.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A good test is trotting in a circle and changing diagonals every five steps,” Dyson says. “Does the horse feel different on one diagonal compared to another? A normal horse should feel similar.”\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Your horse feels choppy or rigid.\\n\\nA lame horse shortens his stride to reduce the amount of time he’s putting weight on a sore limb. “The horse might feel choppier than he used to and less free-moving,” Dyson says. This is particularly true when both forelimbs are lame because neither limb is comfortable under the weight.\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes horses’ choppiness translates into missteps and stumbles, adds Werner. Stumbling in front or behind consistently could indicate lameness, with the heel area a likely cause, she says.\\n\\n',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Heather Smith Thomas\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider the big picture, from farrier care and diet to environment and genetics\\n\\nMy horse is barefoot. And sound. And his feet look pretty great, if you ask me. What can I do to keep them this way? Are there special products I should be using or certain ways I should be managing them? What if someday he needs shoes?\\n\\n\\n\\nThese are just a few of the many questions horse owners ask about their horses’ feet. They’ve heard about or have managed less-ideal feet, so it’s only natural to want to keep things going the way they are and stave off problems. We gathered advice from two farriers on how to have the healthiest of hooves, with or without shoes.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaul Goodness, CJF, a farrier at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine’s (VMCVM) Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center, in Leesburg, says horses’ feet are fairly resilient and can adapt to many conditions, but sometimes they need a little help. Travis Burns, CJF, TE, EE, FWCF, assistant professor of practice and chief of farrier services at the VMCVM, agrees, and says horse owners can do many things to help their horses maintain healthy hoof capsules.\\n\\n\\n\\nGenetics: Start With Good Feet and Legs\\n\\n“If I could give one piece of advice, it would be simply to buy or breed horses based on conformation and hoof quality,” says Burns. “It’s far easier to have healthy feet by buying/breeding horses that already have good feet.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a horse has poor hoof quality, then the owner is fighting that problem for the rest of the horse’s life, he explains. It can be a constant challenge to keep the feet healthy and sound and/or shoes on.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndeed, hoof conformation, strength, and durability are mainly genetic. Some horses just have much stronger feet than others. Environment, hoof care, and nutrition can make a difference, but the horse that starts out with strong, well-conformed feet is less apt to be adversely affected by poor conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoodness says horses are born with certain attributes that dictate basic hoof angle and shape.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor instance, “the shape and density of P3 (the third phalanx, or coffin bone) has a direct influence on the outer structure of the hoof,” he says. “The angle and length of the pastern bones also help determine the angle and shape of the hoof. If a horse is born with upright pasterns, he may have a propensity to be club-footed. If he has long, sloping pasterns, he’ll have a more sloping hoof and longer toe, with lower heels.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe No-Brainer: Farrier Care\\n\\nThe most important thing you can do for your horse’s hooves is to schedule regular trims to keep them in proper shape and balance.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile some owners think bare feet only need trimming once or twice a year, most horses need much more frequent trims to keep the hoof capsule properly balanced (so structures are stressed evenly) and to keep the edges from cracking and chipping, Burns says. Trim cycles can span four to eight weeks, depending on the horse, he adds.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Each horse … has a unique rate of hoof growth and a different need for trimming frequency,” says Goodness. “This can also vary due to the type of work and the time of year.” Hoof horn tends to grow faster during summer, perhaps due to optimum nutrition in green grass, and slower during winter.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Most horses should be checked by a farrier or hoof care specialist regularly, if for no other reason than to check for abnormal conditions that might benefit from some kind of action,” he continues. Your farrier might discover problems, such as thrush, white line disease, bruising, or a chip or crack in the hoof wall, in the early stages and intervene before the situation becomes serious—and more expensive to fix.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The farrier is in a good position to help keep the feet healthy and to answer any questions the owner might have, especially a new owner,” Goodness says.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental Influences\\n\\nHorses have an incredible ability to adapt to wherever we put them. It takes time, however, for their feet to acclimate to wetter, drier, softer, or harder \\xadconditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not all horses can adapt on their own, so the horse owner can play an important role in assisting with that adaptive period,” Goodness says. “If horses are living in a moist area, or there’s a time of year when the footing is very wet and feet become too soft, we need to give them an area in their paddock that’s higher and drier where they can get out of the mud and enable the foot to dry out a bit.” As a general rule of thumb, feet are healthier when they are not constantly wet.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Clair Thunes\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. We’re planning to take our horses camping for the first time this summer. What recommendations do you have for feeding horses during overnight trips in the wilderness?\\n\\n\\n\\nA. When riding in the wilderness, you need to consider:\\n\\nFederal and local regulations for taking hay and feed into public lands;\\n\\nHow much feed you horse will need;\\n\\nThat your horse will be under extra stress during travel and exertion;\\n\\nYour horse’s salt, electrolyte, and water needs; and\\n\\nAdapting to a different feeding schedule while away from home.\\n\\nProtecting Public Lands From Noxious Weeds\\n\\nOur public lands are threatened by nonnative plant species brought in through various means, such as migrating wildlife, clothing, vehicles, and livestock. Such plants find an environment where typically no natural means exist to keep them in check and, as a result, many thousands of acres can become impacted. As such, state and federal public land management agencies spend considerable time and money trying to eradicate these noxious weeds through various means such as chemical herbicides or physically removing them. It’s no surprise then that some agencies require horse owners riding and camping in public lands to pack and use certified weed-free feed as a means of reducing the introduction of noxious weed seeds.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen planning to go camping with your horse on publicaly managed land, find out ahead of time whether restrictions apply in that area. You do not want to find out on arrival that the feed you’ve brought with you isn’t allowed. Note: Under the U.S. Wilderness Act of 1964, lands designated as “wilderness areas” automatically require weed free feed to be fed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf some or all of the areas you’re visiting require weed-free feed, you’ll need to do some homework. Ideally you’ll find a weed-free version of the forage you currently feed your horse so no major dietary changes are required. You might also be able to find certified weed-free hay. Try searching online for “certified weed-free hay,” plus the name of your state or county.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome states or county agricultural commissions keep a list of hay that they have certified as free of weeds. This means that the hay contains none of the noxious weeds as designated by that state or county. Farmers have to harvest hay from an inspected field within a set time period post-inspection to ensure that no weeds have since grown. Keep in mind that hay certified in one area might not pass muster in another, because different areas consider different weeds to be noxious. Certified weed-free compression bales (tightly baled hay meant for shipping) are available, which can be handy if you’re going on an extended trip, because they take up less space. Don’t be fooled by their small size however: They weigh just the same as a full-size bale!\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you can’t find hay bales, then hay pellets are an option. In fact, in some areas pellets are required. To be weed-free pellets must have been processed at a high enough temperature and ground to a fine enough particle size that no weed seed would be able to survive and germinate. For this reason cubes are typically not acceptable—they’re not processed at a high enough temperature and the particles have not been ground to a fine enough size. Try to find a pelleted version of the same type of hay your horse normally receives (e.g., Timothy pellets if you feed Timothy hay) to reduce dietary changes and their impact on horses’ digestive tracts.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegardless of whether the pellets are the same type of hay you normally feed your horse, you should give your horse a transition period between his current and new forage and feed. Slowly introduce the hay or hay pellet you will be feeding over a period of seven to 10 days prior to your trip.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Much Feed and Forage to Take With You\\n\\nHow much to take with you depends on a number of factors, most notably whether grazing is option. If you horse can graze for several hours a day on good quality grass, this might significantly reduce the amount of other forage needed. However, be cautious if your horse does not typically have access to pasture at home, because its sudden introduction could lead to gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea, and colic. It’s better to play it safe and limit grass intake and rely on the forage you are bringing, or try to introduce pasture before embarking on your trip.\\n\\n\\n\\nPellets are more digestible than hay and, therefore, horses tend to get by on slightly less weight of pellets than they would if fed the same type of forage as long-stem hay. Weigh the amount of hay you’re feeding at home each day and plan to bring the same amount of pounds or kilograms as pellets multiplied by the number of days you will be traveling. Running out of feed is never good, so err on the side of bringing enough for one or two extra days, just in case. The same would apply for hay, too—bring extra!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Stress of Travel and Riding\\n\\nHaving extra with you will also allow you to increase intake if you notice that your horse is dropping weight. Horses can find being away from home stressful, especially if living in close quarters with unfamiliar horses. It can also be easy to get carried away when riding in a group of friends and do more work with your horse than they’re conditioned for. Horses will often exert themselves more in a group than they would on their own. Be realistic of how fit your horse is and how much you are asking them to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nSalt and Electrolytes\\n\\nMake sure that you provide a salt source at night so your horse can replenish electrolytes lost in sweat. If the weather is hot and the riding days are long it might be hard for him to get enough from a block. Instead, consider feeding loose salt in a pan or adding 1 tablespoon per 500 pounds body weight to your horse’s feed. I recommend doing this 365 days of the year but at the very least start a week before you leave to insure electrolyte levels are built up before your trip and then maintain through your trip and for a few days once home.\\n\\n\\n\\nElectrolyte products can also be useful to have on hand as they can be more palatable than large quantities of salt and are formulated to replace sweat losses. Avoid products with dextrose (a fancy way of saying sugar) as the first ingredient and look for gram quantities of sodium and chloride. Feed the electrolyte according to the directions in addition to daily salt. Having a paste electrolyte in your saddle bag on long hot ride days is wise, especially if you will be working your horse hard and possibly above his comfort zone. The paste can be easily administered while on the trail one to two hours into your ride. This should encourage your horse to keep drinking.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you lived some before the 17th century, there is a good chance you’d be convinced that an iron (Fe) deficiency caused baldness. One of the suggested treatments at the time was consuming iron-tempered wine, produced by placing Fe filings or a rusty knife in a glass of wine. Later in the 17th century, doctors began using Fe to treat anemia. Today Fe’s role in oxygen transport is well-understood, and researchers estimate that as much as 60% of the body’s Fe can be found in blood hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that circulates oxygen throughout the body).\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Fe content varies by geographic location, it remains one of the most abundant metals in soil and rock. Plant Fe content tends to reflect that of the soil, but soil type can affect the availability of soil Fe. When taking pasture samples for nutrient analysis purposes, especially if Fe is a nutrient of interest, it is important to take the samples with care. Including soil in your sample will result in an inflated Fe concentration in the final nutrient analysis report, not reflecting the true Fe concentration in your pasture.\\n\\n\\n\\nTypically, forages contain sufficient Fe to meet a horse’s Fe requirement (recommended by the National Research Council, authors of Nutrient Requirements of Horses, 2007) of 400 milligrams per day for a 500-kilogram (1,100 pound) horse used for light exercise. Horses in more intense exercise, broodmares in late pregnancy or lactation, and growing horses have a higher Fe requirement than a horse at rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, Fe deficiency in horses is rare, especially for those with access to pasture and hay. However, foals, similar to other young nursing animals and children, are more susceptible to Fe deficiency than adult horses due to their rapid growth rates. The foal’s digestive tract is efficient at absorbing Fe, and additional Fe supplementation in young foals should only be provided under veterinary supervision. It is thought that a true Fe deficiency or anemia in an adult horse would more likely be due to prolonged or excessive blood loss than insufficient dietary Fe intake.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Tom Hallman\\n\\n\\n\\nA five-milligram mosquito can slay a 1,000-pound horse in a matter of days. All it needs is the right virus.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut with your help, the horse can survive the attack. All you need is the right vaccine — at the right time.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow’s the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Last year in South Carolina, we had 10 cases of West Nile Virus in horses and another nine of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE),” said Sean Eastman, director of field services for the Animal Health Programs branch of Clemson University Livestock-Poultry Health.\\n\\n\\n\\n“These diseases have a very high mortality rate in exposed, unvaccinated horses — between 30 and 40 percent for West Nile and 90 percent for EEE,” Eastman said. “With the emergence of mosquitoes and the appearance of these viruses in nearby states, proper vaccination for horses is essential.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWest Nile and EEE are transmitted to horses by mosquitoes, often the black-tailed mosquito, Culiseta melanura, which is a scourge from Maine to Mexico. Reducing mosquito populations around the farm is a good first step, but only vaccination can prevent the disease from developing once a tiny infected assassin buzzes into the barn.\\n\\n\\n\\nLivestock-Poultry Health, a regulatory arm of Clemson’s Public Service and Agriculture unit, recommends at least annual vaccinations for both Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, West Nile Virus and rabies in consultation with the owner’s veterinarian. A diagnosis or symptoms suggesting any of these diseases are required to be reported to the state veterinarian’s office within 48 hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n“These diseases can quickly get out of hand if we don’t vaccinate horses,” said Boyd Parr, state veterinarian and Livestock-Poultry Health director. “The best defense is for owners to maintain current equine vaccinations for their horses.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough tetanus is not among the required “reportable diseases,” Parr and Eastman highly recommend that horses be vaccinated for tetanus at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The first thing they showed us in veterinary school was a video of people who had contracted rabies. I guarantee you, if you’d ever seen that video you would have your horse vaccinated immediately,” Eastman said. “And EEE is a quickly progressing disease, but it’s preventable with a vaccine. It’s not a hard thing to do.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Palmetto State has made progress in combatting these common equine diseases. In 2013, South Carolina led the nation with 49 cases of EEE in horses, 48 of which died. The numbers have come down gradually, but the state isn’t out of the woods yet.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When I was a commercial veterinarian I would ask my customers, would you like to pay $40 now or several thousand to treat your horse later and hope the treatment works,” said Eastman, who now directs Livestock-Poultry Health animal health inspectors who routinely visit sale barns across the state. “It honestly may come down to a choice between a dead horse or spending $40 to keep him safe.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEEE symptoms\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough people are not immune, Eastern Equine Encephalitis is a rare illness in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people infected will show no apparent illness, but severe cases begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. It can be fatal. People who are concerned should contact their physicians, Parr said.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms in horses usually develop from two to five days after exposure. These include stumbling, circling, head-pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, inability to stand, muscle twitching or death.\\n\\n\\n\\nWest Nile symptoms\\n\\n\\n\\nMost people infected with the West Nile virus, the CDC says, do not show signs of it at all. The rest, about 20 percent, may develop a fever with other symptoms, such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash, but most will recover completely, though weakness and fatigue may linger.\\n\\n\\n\\nA small number, about 1 in 150, develop a severe illness that affects the central nervous system, such as encephalitis or meningitis. About 10 percent of those will die, according to the CDC.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn horses, West Nile infection often produces flu-like signs, including depression and mild anorexia; occasional drowsiness; skin sensitivity and brief, spontaneous contractions of fine and coarse muscle and skin tissue; changes in mental activity, such as lack of attention; weakness and the loss of control of body movements, such as propulsive walking or pushing forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: clemson.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Pat Raia\\n\\n\\n\\nMinimize your horse’s risk of ingesting a deadly plant by identifying and removing harmful species from in and around barns and pastures\\n\\nOne spring a few years ago, four horses on a Colorado farm began losing weight and developed photosensitization (a condition characterized by sensitivity to sun exposure) and neurologic signs. A thorough physical exam and blood work helped veterinarians determine the horses had extensive chronic liver disease, and a liver biopsy confirmed typical signs of pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning. These alkaloids are typically found in groundsels such as tansy ragwort, fiddle neck, and rattle pod. However, none of these plants were present in the horses’ pasture.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when the horses’ owner broke open a bale from the hay supply he had been feeding all winter, he noticed significant amounts of broad, hairy leaves that were eight to 12 inches long. These leaves were identified as hound’s tongue, a noxious weed in many areas across the country that contains significant quantities of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Hound’s tongue remains toxic even when dried in hay. These alkaloids have a cumulative effect on the liver, and after eating the contaminated hay over the winter, the horses developed chronic irreversible liver disease. Eventually, all four of the affected horses were euthanized because of liver failure.\\n\\n\\n\\nHound’s tongue is one of myriad plants toxic enough to cause illness and even death in horses. So it’s important that owners recognize poisonous plants growing in or near their horses’ pastures and prevent their animals from ingesting them.\\n\\n\\n\\nToxic Plants: Know Your Enemy\\n\\nAccording to Carey Williams, PhD, equine Extension specialist at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, horses generally avoid eating poisonous plants, especially when more palatable choices are available.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Most poisonous plants have defense mechanisms—syrup or sap that’s very bitter or spines and thorns that make them uncomfortable to chew or swallow—so horses will generally avoid them, especially if they have lots of good-quality hay and good-quality pasture available to them,” she says.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven so, some harmful plants are attractive to horses at certain times of the year. For example, wilted red maple leaves are among the plants most toxic to horses. But they can be hard for horses to resist because the leaves’ high sugar content draws the animals. Horses can be exposed to red maple leaves in the fall when drying leaves blow into pastures. Ingesting 1 ½ pounds is toxic in a horse; three pounds is lethal.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Red maple has an oxidant that destroys hemoglobin—red blood cells,” says Anthony P. Knight, BVSc, MS, Dipl. ACVIM, professor emeritus at the Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and author of A Guide to Plant Poisoning of Animals in North America. “Horses will present with weakness, jaundice, and anemia, and urine may turn dark brown as the body filters out the dead cells.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOther plants outside pastures can be toxic to horses as well—ornamental plants used in landscaping, such as rhododendron, azalea, and yew, for example. The latter ornamental plant is an evergreen, so it and other evergreens remain toxic year-round because they never lose their leaves. Between 10 and 15 ounces of yew leaves are sufficient to kill a 1,000-pound horse.\\n\\n\\n\\nOleander is a leafy, flowering drought-resistant plant often used in ornamental landscaping in California and across the Southern states to Florida. It contains cardiac glycosides—naturally occurring compounds that can cause colic, loss of coordination, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, abnormal heart function, muscle tremors, and potentially death from cardiac failure.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A few mouthfuls of oleander leaves can be fatal to a horse,” says Knight. “The toxin is similar to digitalis (a drug that comes from the foxglove plant and is prescribed to certain heart patients); it works on the heart, affecting normal heart rhythm.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOften these plants are introduced into a horse’s environment via a well-meaning neighbor. “A farm might have a neighbor right next door, and the neighbor might clip rhododendron, azalea, or Japanese yew plants and put the clippings in the pasture thinking, ‘I’ll feed the horses,’ ” Williams says. The best thing an owner can do to prevent this from happening is to talk with neighbors and ask them not to feed the horses anything, including lawn and garden clippings.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome weeds and wildflowers put horses at risk for poisoning as well, says Knight. One such plant found nationwide is the weed Senecio, also known as groundsel. Senecio‘s toxic effects can take a month or more to appear in horses, but clinical signs of Senecio-related poisoning are generally easy to identify, Knight says.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Senecio gradually destroys the liver, causing the owner to see weight loss, jaundiced eyes, and in white skinned areas photosensitization that looks like severe sunburn,” he says. At this stage, there is no effective treatment or way to reverse the liver damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe effects of water hemlock ingestion, for instance, are much more immediate. Found just about everywhere in the United States where there is water, this is one of the most poisonous native plants. It contains the unsaturated alcohol cicutoxin in all parts of the plant, especially in the roots and stem base. The toxin causes severe stimulation and paralysis of the nervous system. The plant is highly toxic; two or three ounces can kill.\\n\\n\\n\\nDepending on the area of the country, other plants can be a problem when horses are forced to consume them because little good quality pasture or hay is available. For example, locoweed in the Western states can cause irreversible neurologic signs in horses; Russian knapweed and yellow star thistle will cause permanent brain damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nDetection and Prevention\\n\\nOwners need to be extremely sensitive to changes in their horses’ appearance and behavior in order to detect possible plant poisoning. “It’s important to know your horse well—what is normal for your horse,” Williams says. “And if you suspect the horse has ingested something toxic, call your veterinarian right away. Then call your extension agent to walk the pasture with the veterinarian to find the culprit.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Williams and Knight advise owners to know their horses’ environments well, too. “The first thing people should do is walk their pastures to see what kind of plants are growing there to identify the ones that are toxic to their horses,” Williams says. To help identify poisonous plants in your pasture, take a look at the list.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And anytime you find a plant you can’t identify or are not familiar with, take a digital photo of the plant and e-mail it to your extension agent,” says Knight. Your county Extension agent can even come out to the farm and identify toxic plants prevalent in your region.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Christa Lesté-Lasserre\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat purpose does equine legwear really serve?\\n\\nGoing out for a few jumps in the arena? Buckle on the brushing boots. Heading for a haul in the trailer? Strap on those well-padded, hock-high transport boots. Treating a leg wound? Apply sheet cotton and that brightly colored flexible bandage.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s what we’ve seen other people do; it’s what we’ve been taught to do; it’s simply what we know to do. But why exactly do we do it? Of course, the short answer is “protection.” Boots and wraps protect the horse’s limbs. But have you ever asked yourself why or how these dressings protect a horse’s leg—or if they even do? What’s going on under that boot or wrap?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou might be surprised to learn there’s actually very little research about the inner workings of the equine leg when wraps and boots are applied. It’s a growing field that still needs lots of “padding” and extra “layers” of research before we can fully understand it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in the meantime, we’ve gone to some of today’s top equine biomechanics researchers to get a better grasp on the science of the wrap and to help us unravel some of its mysteries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWrapping Leg Injuries\\n\\nYou know the feeling—when you walk into your horse’s paddock and find the dreaded leg gash. You don’t know how he did it but you do know what to do about it. Bring out the bandages, because nothing says leg wound treatment like good a wrap.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether it’s something we’ve learned from experience, from veterinary advice, or from reading about horse care, we know that using padding and bandages to wrap a leg wound is essential first aid. What we might not know, though, is why.\\n\\n\\n\\nSure, pressure to any wound will help stop bleeding by encouraging clotting. And a wrap will help protect that wound from contamination. You might also know that wrapping a leg wound can help reduce swelling. In fact, keeping the swelling down could be the most important part of the healing process.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The equine body’s response to injury in the distal (lower) limb is to swell, which can be protective in some ways (like reducing bleeding immediately after injury) but detrimental if not resolved in the later stages of wound healing,” says Nathan Canada, DVM, MS, Dipl. ACVS, staff surgeon at Texas Equine Hospital, in Bryan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow does that work? It primarily comes down to a fascinating process of physics, says Canada. “There’s a high-pressure system going through the blood vessels between the heart and the injured area, pumping lots of fluid to that injury,” he says. “But wraps increase the pressure on that injured area from the outside, so that it increases the pressure on the interstitial tissues (those between the cells of structures, in this case beneath the skin) in a way that tries to balance out the (wrap) pressure, so there’s no longer a net force trying to drive the fluid out of the vascular system.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe likens a leg injury’s tendency to swell to how a garden hose works. “Think of turning on the hose,” he says. “The water’s going to go from high pressure to low pressure areas.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s also a chemical process going on at the cellular level, Canada says. Essentially, injury-induced inflammation affects the proteins in the bloodstream, which then affect the cytokines (inflammatory proteins) and cellular pathways. Those cause the blood vessel barriers to become “leaky,” allowing more fluid to seep into the surrounding tissues.\\n\\n\\n\\n“By putting on a pressure wrap, we’re applying pressure to the skin, and that pressure is transmitted to the deeper tissues of the body,” he says. “That will ultimately raise the pressure within that interstitial fluid—(which serves as) the communication channel between the blood vessel and the rest of the body—and make it a more equal plane.”\\n\\nIt works so well, in fact, that the pressure even helps reduce swelling and aid healing of tendon injuries. “Anything you put on the outside of the skin is going to transmit that pressure to whatever soft tissues are underneath it,” Canada says. “So that will help with reducing swelling in tendons and ligaments, although the extent of that hasn’t been investigated. But any time you have a tendon injury, one of the first things you should do is give it support by applying some sort of \\xadpressure.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile pressure can be great for leg wounds, the wrong kind of pressure can be detrimental, he cautions. Unevenly distributed pressure—which can come from applying bandages with irregular overlap—can cause pressure peaks that can create direct trauma to the tendon or affect the blood flow to it. This, he says, is a common cause of bowed tendons. Reduce risk by always using padding (e.g., pillow pads) beneath the wrap to help distribute pressure, and keep bandage overlaps as even as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nWrapping for Travel\\n\\nGoing on a road trip? Pull out the transport wraps. Again, we experienced horse people know that putting shipping boots or bandages on our traveling horses is just something you do.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut peer pressure isn’t the reason to wrap a trailered horse. Leg pressure, on the other hand, is.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There actually is a purpose,” Canada says. “Horses were meant to walk around all day, and the blood flow in their legs is dependent on them moving around. So a horse that’s just standing still for long periods of time can ‘stock up’—meaning they get edema (fluid swelling) within their distal limbs.” That swelling can be painful in some horses and even predispose them to getting scratches (the skin infection also known as pastern dermatitis) because the skin becomes fragile.\\n\\n\\n\\nPressure from transport wraps can help prevent stocking up in any immobile horse. In essentially the same scientific phenomenon as we described for wrapping wounds, pressure to the legs helps even out blood pressure to keep fluid from collecting in the lower limbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much pressure is necessary? Researchers haven’t come up with a firm answer yet, says Canada. But interstitial pressure is already very low compared to vascular (blood vessel) pressure. So even light pressure, like you might get from the larger, padded, Velcro-strapped transport boots, could prevent fluid buildup.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Taylor Fabus\\n\\n\\n\\nMany horse enthusiasts may not know that body clipping can serve purposes other than simply aesthetics. In this Michigan State University Extension article, we’ll explore a variety of uses for clipping horses and learn many tricks to improve your overall clipping performance and final product.\\n\\n\\n\\nHorses can be clipped for several different reasons, but most commonly it is related to health and comfort reasons. One such health condition where horses are clipped is Cushing’s, a disease that can cause a horse to not shed its winter coat properly. Clipping a horse suffering from Cushing’s disease, even with a partial clip, allows a horse to regulate their body temperature more effectively in the summer and winter months.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, during winter months, you may perform a trace clip on a horse to better diffuse heat while working. A trace clip is where only a portion of the horse’s body is clipped. This reduces the sweat produced during work, as well as the time it takes a horse to cool down and dry off after work. There are many different types of trace clips to choose from, each serving a slightly different purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the summer months, you may perform an entire body clip on horses. This gives a clean, tidy appearance and can aid in show preparation by reducing the time it takes to wash. Before beginning to clip, remember that a horse will not be show ready overnight from a clip. Allow at least two weeks for hair to settle and grow out after a clip for optimum result.\\n\\n\\n\\nA basic list of supplies to clip a horse will include body clippers, blade wash and coolant, a set of rechargeable clippers, towels, twitch, coat conditioner, sidewalk chalk and a variety of brushes. Body clippers are heavier duty clippers compared to the ones used to clean up whiskers and ears. You should also have a set of quiet, rechargeable clippers to get in tiny spaces and do clean ups.\\n\\n\\n\\nA standard body clip is done with a #10 blade, and you should have at least three blades on hand. Blade cleaning supplies include blade wash and blade coolant. Things that aren’t exactly necessary, but can be very useful to have on hand, include a twitch, coat conditioner such as Showsheen, towels and one unexpected tool: sidewalk chalk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBody clipping supplies.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe very first step for the best clip starts with bathing the horse. Ensure all dirt, mud and excess loose hair is off the horse. Clipper blades dull quicker with dirt and grime and they will not leave a smooth finish if there is dirt in the undercoat. After bathing and drying, curry the horse thoroughly to bring out all loose hair. Finish with a spray of coat conditioner and work it in with a stiff dandy brush. Keep that brush on hand to groom as you clip.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf doing a trace clip, it helps to give yourself guidelines to follow. This is where the sidewalk chalk comes in; it works great for this purpose. Choose a chalk color that will show up on your horse and then wet the chalk to make lines where the edge of your clip will be. If you mess up, simply wipe away and restart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarking lines on the horse using chalk can help give you a guide to follow as you attempt a trace clip.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter prepping the horse, start at the shoulder where the horse can see you. Turn on the clippers and make sure the horse is comfortable with the noise and feel of the clippers. Patience is key—you have a long way to go. Clip against the grain of the hair using light pressure, and let the blade cut the hair. Do not force the blade through the hair or you will end up with lines.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you clip, you may notice very faint, tiny lines from your clippers. These fine lines are normal. Lines that are 1/8 inch apart with hair significantly longer than the rest are not normal. If this is happening, clean your blade by pouring a pool of blade wash into a small container and running the blade in the wash. If this does not solve your problem, there is a good chance you need to swap out your blade for a new one. It is completely normal to use two to three blades on a horse, especially if they have been re-sharpened.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you force the blade through the hair, you can end up with rough lines.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you have clipped your preferred trace or the full body, you can move on to the legs. Legs have hair that is significantly coarser than the body hair. If you have a horse with excessive leg hair, trim it back with scissors prior to clipping. This will save time and wear on your expensive clipper blades. Make sure you clip the legs from every angle possible. If needed, have a friend lift a leg so you can get every spot of the opposing leg.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last piece to clip, and most important part, is the head. Every time you do a horse’s head, have a fresh blade and take your time. Start wherever your horse is most comfortable and save the hardest spots, typically the ears, for last. If your horse is incredibly unhappy about their ears, muzzle or eyes, feel free to apply a twitch for a limited amount of time and work quickly. It is important to make this a good experience for the horse so that future clippings will not be difficult.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a few important things to keep in mind as you clip. First, make sure to brush and towel off your horse. You want to clip every inch, so brushing away the excess hair will give you a clearer view of what hair still needs to be clipped. Touch ups, at a later date, are always an option, but it’s best to avoid them. Also, keep an eye on the temperature of your blades. If they feel warm to the touch, spray with coolant or swap out the blade. Sometimes horses will start to dance or move away from the clipper—they could be telling that the blade is too hot.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour final step to clipping your horse is another bath. The tiny hairs produced by clipping are incredibly itchy. Make sure they are all off your horse and give them a good condition to rehydrate the open hair follicles. Cover your horse in a thick, wool cooler to dry and give them some hay to munch on. Keep a close eye on how your horse reacts to the weather in the next few days, as they may need an extra blanket or sheet without their long coat.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is crucial to give a freshly clipped horse a thorough bath.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot only can clipping be useful, it can also lead to a career or supplemental income.\\n\\nSource: msu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Natalie DeFee Mendik\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s nothing appealing about sweet itch; here’s the latest on managing this chronic skin condition\\n\\nSweet itch, seasonal equine dermatitis, Culicoides hypersensitivity, summer dermatitis—they’re all one and the same. So what is this seasonal skin condition, exactly? Biting midges or gnats, namely Culicoides (colloquially known as ‘no-see-ums’), can trigger an allergic reaction when they bite a horse.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not the simple puncture of the skin that causes the reaction but, rather, the insects’ saliva. In the same way some people develop a rash after exposure to certain allergens, but others don’t, some horses become abnormally sensitive—or sensitized—to midge saliva.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Insect-bite hypersensitivity is the most common allergy in horses,” says Rosanna Marsella, DVM, Dipl. ACVD, professor at the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine, in Gainesville. Here, she and Julia Miller, DVM, dermatology resident at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, in Ithaca, New York, will share current information about sweet itch prevention and \\xadtreatment.\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle Insect, Big Troublemaker\\n\\nCulicoides are small, weak-flying insects that can’t cover long distances or fly against a breeze, so they tend to feed at night and live near water.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn many areas sweet itch is seasonal, says Marsella, although where she lives Culicoides are active year-round. In addition, there are many Culicoides species that feed on different parts of the horse. “The species of Culicoides that are present on the farm determine the distribution of lesions on affected horses,” she says. “In a place like Florida we have over 20 different species of Culicoides; the more species present, the more generalized the distribution of lesions on the horse.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAffected areas of the body might include:\\n\\nMane and tail;\\n\\nVentral midline (the center of the belly);\\n\\nLegs;\\n\\nFace and ears; or\\n\\nA combination of these.\\n\\nTwo Conditions and Lots of Allergies\\n\\nHorses sensitized to Culicoides saliva can develop two types of hypersensitivity. “One (Type 1) is an immediate reaction, which is why some horses may present with hives,” says Marsella. “The other (Type 4) is a delayed reaction, with signs of itch in particular body locations 24 to 48 hours after the bite. These two types of allergies are mediated by different chemicals in the body. Many horses have both.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMarsella says effective treatment options for Type 1 hypersensitivity include antihistamines, as well as a customized vaccine to desensitize the horse to the allergen. For Type 4 sensitivity a vaccine does not work. “When it comes down to horses with insect allergy, the majority of management is avoidance,” she says.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther, Culicoides hypersensitivity is rarely a stand-alone condition. “To complicate things, the majority of horses that are sensitized to gnats are also atopic, a genetically inherited condition that occurs in various species, including people, where there is a propensity toward building allergies to whatever comes your way,” Marsella says. “In people, an example is eczema (an itchy skin inflammation): If you have eczema as a child, you may become sensitized to foods, ragweed, trees, pollen, dust. In the management of these horses, it’s important to identify the different components that add to that itch.”\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Donald Stotts\\n\\n\\n\\nHorse managers can learn a lot from mothers who tell kids to eat what is on their plates so they will grow up big and strong.\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerally, 50 percent to 60 percent of a horse’s mature weight is reached by 12 months of age, and 80 percent to 90 percent is reached by 24 months of age. These are the growing years, and a bit of applied “motherly concern” can last a horse’s lifetime.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever the breed of horse, nutrition is a key component to managing for sound growth, reminds Kris Hiney, Oklahoma State University Cooperative Extension equine specialist.\\n\\n\\n\\n“While nutrition may not overcome poor genetics or a poorly designed exercise program, studies show it can significantly affect the health of growing horses,” she said. “Level of intake and ration composition play important roles in altering rate and composition of gain.”\\n\\n\\n\\nResearch indicates restricting intake to achieve a slow increase in wither height during early growth leads to future problems if a young horse is later fed to abruptly increase its size or condition. In addition, final mature height of the horse may be affected if restriction of feed is extreme.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, the rate of bone and muscle growth in horses slows as the animal matures. As a result, providing excess nutrition will result in more deposition of fat, a problem shared by certain two-legged mammals that travel in cars.\\n\\n\\n\\nHiney cautions horse managers to remember yearlings on high planes of nutrition are more susceptible than weanlings to laying down larger quantities of fat, and thus require close regulation of intake and exercise level.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Maintaining young, growing horses in extremely thin conditions may limit sound skeletal growth later in life, while excess fat creates more weight stress on legs and reduces the horse’s athletic ability; the goal is to reach a happy medium,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe exact body condition and rate of gain needed to promote sound growth of muscle and bone is debatable, and perhaps even somewhat flexible.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Individual differences in the genetic makeup of horses create so much variation that general recommendations are limited in scope and accuracy,” Hiney said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, because there may be differences in the rate at which bone and muscle mature, it may be desirable for some horses to grow at slower rates than others to allow for a coordinated development of both bodily systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In most cases, young horses should be maintained in moderate body condition to promote the proper development of bone and muscle,” Hiney said.\\n\\n\\n\\nVisual clues tell the tale\\n\\n\\n\\nBody condition can be estimated visually by observing fat cover on the horse’s body. Indications of a moderate condition are that individual ribs cannot be seen but can be easily felt, the area around the tailhead is slightly rounded in appearance and the backbone is level with surrounding tissue on the back and loin.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Changes in body condition should be monitored individually because young horses differ in the amount of fat that is deposited at similar feed intake and exercise levels,” Hiney said. “Just remember estimates based on a ‘typical horse’ are exactly that, estimates.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWeanlings expected to mature at 1,300 pounds typically will gain 1.5 pounds to 2 pounds per day. Yearlings will gain less, 1 pound to 1.5 pounds per day. Two-year-old horses should gain 0.5 pound to 0.75 pound per day.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo support moderate growth, nursing foals may consume between 1 pound and 1.5 pounds of creep feed per 100 pounds of body weight a day. Weanlings may consume 1.5 pounds to 2.5 pounds of grain mix per 100 pounds of body weight a day. Yearlings may consume 1 pound to 2 pounds of grain mix per 100 pounds of body weight a day.\\n\\n\\n\\nHiney cautioned horse managers need to be particularly careful with nutrient supplies when feeding a horse for rapid growth, as skeletal and cartilage issues can easily arise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is some indication that feeding high-starch diets with a high glycemin index may not be the best thing for cartilage formation,” she said. “Slow and steady is ideal for long-term health.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRemember, estimates are only a baseline, as the level of exercise will affect a horse’s nutrient requirements. Nutrients in the feed must be balanced with each other to ensure the individual horse’s needs for energy, protein and minerals are met.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost weanling grain mixes contain between 1.3 and 1.5 mega-calories of digestible energy per pound. To ensure the ration supplies adequate protein and minerals for these energy densities, grain mixes for weanlings and yearlings should contain between 12 percent and 14 percent crude protein, 0.6 percent calcium and 0.4 percent phosphorus.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Rations should be combined with high-quality hay,” Hiney said. “Keep in mind the amount and nutrient content of the hay will affect the amount of nutrients needed in the grain mixes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFeedstuff evaluation and paperwork\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluations of rations fed to growing horses should include checks of nutrient-to-calorie ratios.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are many minerals that can cause growth problems when fed in either deficient or excessive amounts,” Hiney said. “As high levels of some minerals may interfere with absorption of other minerals, it is important to avoid over-supplementation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMineral supplements are not necessary when feeding most commercially prepared rations formulated for growing horses because these mixes already have been supplemented. Rations using hays and grains that are not supplemented typically will be below the recommended levels for zinc, copper and sodium.\\n\\n\\n\\nVitamins also are a concern. Commercially prepared grain mixes usually will already be supplemented with vitamins A, D and E, as well as several B vitamins.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Horse managers feeding grain mixes that have not been supplemented should add a vitamin premix that includes these vitamins,” Hiney said.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor should horse managers overlook one of the most important aspects of a nutritional plan: record keeping.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Records on weight changes, body condition, nutritional level and health status will provide a framework for management decisions, both for the individual horse and for future generations of growing horses that come from the line,” Hiney said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHiney recommends that horses be assessed every two to three weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional information on the nutritional needs of growing horses is available through all OSU Cooperative Extension county offices, typically listed under “County Government” in local telephone directories.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: okstate.edu',\n",

       "     'text': \"By Todd Hubbs\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics\\n\\nUniversity of Illinois\\n\\nSoybean prices continued to move lower last week as trade issues and a strong start to the growing season continue to pressure prices. At this time, very little positive news is entering the market to support soybean prices on either the supply or demand side. The potential size of the soybean crop and trade uncertainty continue to be the main forces behind soybean price weakness.\\n\\nSlight changes may be forthcoming for 2017-18 marketing year demand estimates in the June WASDE report. Soybean crush continued at a robust pace through the second half of the marketing year. April crush estimates by USDA came in at 172 million bushels. Current USDA estimates of crush during this marketing year total 1.365 billion bushels, six percent above last year's total over the same period. The current pace implies that the crush during the remaining four months of the year must total 625 million bushels, two percent higher than the crush of a year ago over the last four months, to reach the USDA projection of 1.99 billion bushels. Argentinian production is set to come in lower than the current USDA forecast of 1.43 billion bushels and provide some support to domestic crush. Soybean crush shows no signs of weakening this summer in the U.S. and a slight upward adjustment may occur to the domestic crush total in the WASDE report.\\n\\nSoybean exports currently meet the pace needed to meet the projection of 2.065 billion bushels for the 2017-18 marketing year. As of June 7, soybean export inspections total 1.744 billion bushels. Cumulative Census Bureau export estimates from September 2017 through April 2018 exceeded weekly export inspections by 42 million bushels. If the same margin exhibited at the end of March continued through this period, exports through June 7 equaled 1.786 billion bushels. With 12 weeks remaining in the marketing year, 23.3 million bushels per week are necessary to meet the USDA projection. Over the last six weeks, soybean export inspections averaged 24 million bushels per week but varied with a low of 19.6 million bushels on for the week ending May 3 and a high of 33.3 million bushels for the week ending May 17. As of May 31, 332 million bushels of soybean had been sold for export but not shipped. This number exceeds the 279 million bushels necessary to reach 2.065 billion bushels based off of current sales figures and estimated export levels through May 31. USDA estimates of soybean exports appear unlikely to be adjusted for this marketing year, but the potential exists for the USDA to lower 2018-19 marketing year export forecast. Trade issues and a slight increase to Brazilian crop production place the current 2.29 billion bushel projection in question.\\n\\nWhile the current marketing year holds some information about price development, soybean production associated with the next marketing year may provide a more significant impact over the next month. The potential for a large soybean crop is placing pressure on prices currently. Initial concerns about the 2018 soybean crop related to planting seem a distant memory as the early season crop condition report put soybean crops in good or excellent condition at 75 percent, the highest level since 2010. Recent weather developments in the Corn Belt provide no indication of deterioration in crop conditions over the next few weeks. Historically, there is very little correlation between final soybean yield and early season crop condition reports. Summer weather will determine yield, but the current weather looks promising for a large crop. While some dry areas developed over the last few weeks, approximately 10 percent of U.S. soybean acres sit in a moderate drought as of June 5. The 8 - 14 day weather forecast provided by NOAA Climate Prediction Center shows above normal precipitation and warming temperatures over much of the Corn Belt.\\n\\nWhile yield looks promising, soybean acreage is still in question. Soybean planted acreage, as of June 3, came in at 83 percent well ahead of the five-year average of 75 percent. A slow start to the planting season held out the possibility of acreage changes, particularly in the northern Plains. Currently, there is no indication of major acreage changes due to planting issues in the Corn Belt. Since 1997, the average change from the March Prospective Planting report to the June Acreage survey is an increase of 237,000 acres. The most substantial increase occurred in 2014 with a 3.35 million acreage change. A decrease of 3.06 million acres in 2007 was the greatest acreage reduction from March to June. The USDA's Acreage report to be released on June 29 will reveal any acreage changes from intentions published in the March survey.\\n\\nWeather and trade issues will dominate price movements in the soybean market over the next few weeks. Strong crop conditions, a lack of information regarding trade negotiations, and uncertain acreage totals will continue to apply pressure on soybean prices in the near term. A change in the weather or trade negotiations, both very hard to predict, appear necessary for a rally in soybean prices.\",\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrawberries: Renovation is well underway for June bearing strawberries. Malwina harvest is ongoing in southern, central and eastern Ontario. Many growers have mowed the earliest varieties if not all their June bearing strawberries. After mowing.focus on cyclamen mite control. See the steps for applying Agri-mek below. Renovation is also an important time for weed control- after mowing you can use Devrinol or Sinbar for a pre-emergent weed control, and consider a grass herbicide if necessary. Do not use a grass herbicide within 10-14 days of sinbar.\\n\\nDay neutral strawberry harvest is starting up again. Keep these berries picked as regularly as possible to manage SWD. Powdery mildew, tarnished plant bugs, potato leafhoppers, and two spotted spider mites are pests to watch for in day neutrals.\\n\\nMites: approximately 5 days after mowing(when there is new growth) apply Agri-mek for mite control.\\n\\nAgri-mek is registered for Two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) post-harvest. If you are applying agri-mek for TSSM you will achieve some efficacy on cyclamen mite.\\n\\nApply Agri-mek at 225 mL/ha in 750-1000L water /ha, with a non-ionic surfactant at .1-.5%\\n\\nSlow down and get thorough coverage of the plants and crowns.\\n\\nApply Agri-mek under slow-drying conditions to improve uptake into the leaves.\\n\\nDo not apply sinbar after applying Agri-mek. Wait 5-7 days after Agir-mek before applying sinbar.\\n\\nafter applying Agri-mek. Wait 5-7 days after Agir-mek before applying sinbar. Avoid spreading cyclamen mites to new fields; work in new fields before moving to old, infested fields.\\n\\nBlueberries: Blueberry harvest continues, and the crop is looking good in most areas.\\n\\nRaspberries: Harvest is ongoing. Fruit size is smaller in areas because of the hot and dry conditions. .\\n\\nSpotted Wing Drosophila (SWD):.\\n\\nSWD numbers increased slightly this week in southern and south west Ontario. We have seen an increase in the number of sites where SWD was captured again this week, and an increase in the number of SWD in the traps.\\n\\nAll ripening berries are at risk and growers should be managing for SWD. See below for crop-specific strategies.\\n\\nFor all berry crops pick fruit early, clean and often. Cool fruit as quickly as possible after harvest.\\n\\nSpray every 5-7 days, and re-apply after a rain.\\n\\nDon’t spray in temperatures above 27C.\\n\\nSWD is more active in the evening and early mornings. Spray from 6-10 am or 6-10 pm if possible.\\n\\nAlways rotate insecticide groups to reduce the risk of developing insecticide resistance.\\n\\nStrawberries:\\n\\nDo not leave overripe strawberries in the field; SWD populations can build up in this leftover fruit.\\n\\nMow strawberries as soon as possible after harvest to protect later varieties, raspberries and blueberries. Renovate early strawberry varieties before others if you are still harvesting late varieties. Mowing will help fruit dry up and be less attractive to SWD.\\n\\nDay neutral strawberries:\\n\\nAre susceptible to SWD now. Malathion for SWD will also control tarnished plant bug.\\n\\nAvoid using Mako as it can lead to spider mite outbreaks. Save Mako for cooler weather.\\n\\nResearch has shown that Assail has some activity on SWD eggs and larvae, but not adults. Assail can be used now to control leafhoppers in day-neutrals.\\n\\nBlueberries:\\n\\nBlueberries need to be sprayed weekly for SWD at this point if there are SWD in your area. Check our SWD update to see where they have been caught.\\n\\nUse insecticides that will control both SWD and Japanese beetles, such as Exirel and Malathion, if you need to control Japanese beetles this season.\\n\\nSummer Raspberries:\\n\\nGrowers need to maintain insecticide coverage on their summer raspberries if harvest is ongoing. Numbers are lower than this time last year but we have found SWD in raspberry fields, so management is needed. Pick as often as possible.\\n\\nSource : ONfruit',\n",

On a total milk solids basis, exports were equivalent to 17.2 percent of U.S. milk production.\\n\\nOn a total volume basis, U.S. dairy exports were the third-highest ever. May 2018 exports were greater than levels every month before March 2018 when the U.S. began setting new highs. During May, shipments of butterfat and whole milk powder more than doubled while exports of all other major product categories, except cheese and fluid milk, grew double-digit percentages compared to levels in May 2017.\\n\\nMarketers shipped 199,852 tons of milk powder, cheese, butterfat, whey products, and lactose during the month, up 18 percent from May 2017. U.S. exports were worth $512 million, up fractionally vs. a year ago. In the first five months of 2018, dairy exports totaled $2.423 billion, 5 percent more than the same period in 2017.\\n\\nExports of NFDM/SMP increased by 20 percent compared to one year earlier and totaled 70,461 tons. The largest gains came from Southeast Asia (+43 percent), Mexico (+14 percent) and Pakistan (+68 percent).\\n\\n(Official U.S. Bureau of Census data continues to show an increase in WMP exports to Mexico. However, Mexican import data and trade sources don’t corroborate this, and we believe this volume represents SMP sales that were misclassified at the port. Therefore, we’ve adjusted NDM/SMP and WMP trade data for June 2016 to May 2018 to account for this misclassification.)\\n\\nLactose exports totaled 35,126 tons in May, 40 percent greater than levels in May 2017. Shipments to China (8,105 tons) and New Zealand (4,368 tons) drove the increase adding 75 percent and 65 percent, respectively.\\n\\nCheese exports were 29,913 tons in May, 15 percent lower than the previous year. Sales to Mexico declined by 35 percent against last year's record high. Exports also decreased by 24 percent to Japan and were down 54 percent to Australia. These declines were partially offset by gains in South Korea (+12 percent) and the Middle East/North Africa region (+30 percent).\\n\\nWhey exports increased 19 percent and totaled 53,171 tons in May. Shipments increased to Southeast Asia (+77 percent) and Mexico (+48 percent).\\n\\nButterfat exports totaled 3,955 tons, up 121 percent from the year before. Sales to Canada grew by 57 percent and totaled 1,238 tons. Shipments to Mexico added 134 percent and totaled 603 tons.\\n\\nOn a total milk solids basis, U.S. exports were equivalent to 17.2 percent of U.S. milk production in May.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwelve years ago, Terry Edge, in his mid 20s and descended from Wisconsin dairy farmers, turned his back on the family business and took a job in construction. It didn’t last long. Six months later he bought 50 cows, moved them into his grandfather’s old barn, and threw himself into the subtleties of cow breeding, determined not just to follow the old dairying life but to improve on it, raising animals that were healthier and better suited to grazing on the lush green hillsides of southwest Wisconsin.\\n\\n“I went that route thinking it would help me make ends meet,” he says. “But it didn’t work out that way.”\\n\\nNow Mr. Edge has come to the end of the line. He sold most of his cows at an auction last month, undone by a stretch of low milk prices that has lasted 3-1/2 years and imperiled dairy farmers across the country.\\n\\nSome like Edge are being forced out of the dairy business. For others, the hard times are focusing new attention on strategies that go beyond just milking cows in big barns, such as making cheeses or switching to goats or sheep. \\u200bAnd some farmers, pointing to a quota system of production in Canada that keeps milk prices more stable there\\u200b, say new policies might be the answer\\u200b.\\n\\n“This is probably the biggest challenge dairy farmers have faced in their lifetime,” says Darin Von Ruden, a dairy farmer and president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union.\\n\\nOverproduction worldwide has yielded a glut of milk, driving prices below what farmers say it costs them to produce it, for months at a time. Farmers are used to fluctuations in milk prices, but previous downturns have usually lasted only a year or 18 months.\\n\\nThe US Department of Agriculture predicts that milk prices will rise this year and into next. But no one expects a big increase. The Trump administration’s trade disputes and the prospect of trade wars involving agricultural products have only deepened the uncertainty.\\n\\n‘Running as fast as we can’\\n\\nAs this downturn reaches the middle of the fourth year, many farmers are struggling just to hang on, borrowing against land and equipment to pay their bills, betting the farm that prices will turn.\\n\\n“Once you’ve invested a million dollars in a milking parlor, you’re going to milk cows,” says Sarah Lloyd, a farmer in Wisconsin Dells. The result, she says, is that “my husband and I are on the treadmill and we’re running as fast as we can. That’s happening to a lot of families.”\\n\\nNot all farmers are struggling. Some have managed to pay down debts. And, as in other types of farming, large operations often enjoy economies of scale. Big farms can run milking parlors around the clock and negotiate discounts for things like feed and breeding services.\\n\\nWisconsin alone lost about 5 percent of its dairy farms between 2016 and 2017. Just 15 miles west of Edge’s farm, William and Kelle Calvert had gone into debt to buy a 450-acre farm, and gave up dairying because they were afraid of losing everything. They sold their cows to save the farm. Now they cash-crop corn, soybeans, and hay and raise a few animals for other people.\\n\\n“We had a good sale,” says Mr. Calvert, who now works at an agricultural feed company. “There were tears shed, but we felt it was a good day.”\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe and Mary Van Treeck traveled from Alaska to award their scholarship to dairy manufacturing major, Daniel Domenichini.\\n\\nSouth Dakota State University alumnus, Joe Van Treeck, had an illustrious career in the dairy industry and has contributed to the future success of SDSU students by funding a scholarship for 30 years. His contributions to SDSU and the dairy industry have made a lasting impact.\\n\\nVan Treeck graduated from SDSU in 1980 with a dairy manufacturing degree. He was recruited to attend SDSU as a non-traditional student by Shirley Seas, past dairy plant manager, while working at a butter creamery in Rapid City, S.D.\\n\\nPrevious to that, Van Treeck had no background in the dairy industry, growing up north of Chicago. He attended Black Hills State University to play football but decided not to finish his education there and instead went to work in Rapid City at a creamery. While at BHSU, Van Treeck met his wife Mary. Van Treeck and Mary had two children when they decided to make the move to SDSU for Van Treeck to pursue a degree in dairy manufacturing in 1978.\\n\\nWhile at SDSU, Van Treeck was a student foreman in the SDSU Dairy Plant. He made a historic contribution to SDSU as one of two student inventors of the legendary cookies-and-cream ice cream. The other student inventor was Joe Leedom and they were under the supervision of Professor Shirley Seas.\\n\\nHe was also a member of the Dairy Club and the Dairy Products Judging Team.\\n\\n\"Many of my friendships in the industry today were formed when I was involved in Dairy Club as a student,\" said Van Treeck.\\n\\nHe was a contestant for the 1980 SDSU Dairy Products Judging Team and was All Products Champion at the Chicago Regional Competition where the team took top honors. The team placed second at the national competition held in Portland, Ore., that year. Later, he served for ten years as a milk judge for the National Collegiate Dairy Products Evaluation contest.\\n\\n\"Judging was important because I had a knack for the products,\" explained Van Treeck. \"I ended up working in the fluid milk business, so judging paid off from a quality control standpoint.\"\\n\\nVan Treeck received scholarship support as a student that helped him significantly and he was very encouraged that there were people supporting him, so he decided he wanted to provide the same kind of assistance to a student someday. Van Treeck and Mary have now been funding a scholarship for an SDSU student pursuing a degree in dairy for more than 30 years.\\n\\nFollowing graduation, Van Treeck worked for Milnot Corp. in Seneca, Mo., producing canned-evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and butter. He held multiple positions beginning as laboratory manager with successive promotions to plant superintendent.\\n\\nAfter working at Milnot Corp. for five years, Van Treeck was hired as the plant manager of Matanuska Maid Dairy in Anchorage, Alaska in 1985. The Matanuska Maid Dairy was a fluid milk, juice and cultured product processing operation.\\n\\nAlaska\\'s unique West Coast location provided the opportunity to export goods and services and for expansion of market area for Matanuska Maid and other Alaskan-based companies. In support of the business community, the University of Alaska launched the Business-Global Logistics and Supply Chain Management program. Van Treeck seized the opportunity to earn a master\\'s degree in this field while working at Matanuska Maid Dairy to gain a better understanding of how to do business on a global scale. He graduated from the University of Alaska in 2002.\\n\\n\"I worked to turn the Matanuska Maid Dairy around by doing cutting-edge things. We became the second dairy in the country to make yogurt with artificial sweetener and the first dairy to own and manufacture PET plastic bottles for bottling milk, juice and water,\" Van Treeck explained.\\n\\nHe went on to serve more than 20 years as President/CEO and General Manager, becoming the company\\'s longest tenured senior executive. The 71-year-old company ceased operation in late 2007.\\n\\nFollowing the closing of Matanuska Maid Dairy, he served as General Manager for Anchorage Operations for Advanced Supply Chain International. The company provides third-party supply chain, logistics, procurement and maintenance optimization solutions to clients in asset-intensive industries, predominantly the natural resource extractive industries of petroleum and mining.\\n\\nVan Treeck recently retired as CEO of Alaska Glacier Products, LLC in Anchorage, a position he held since 2011. It is Alaska\\'s number one small package bottler of Alaskan glacier sourced water from the Eklutna Glacier.\\n\\nVan Treeck also owned JVT Consulting, a management consultancy providing organizational development, strategic planning, budget creation, procurement, supply chain and logistics solutions primarily for small and start-up food and beverage clientele.\\n\\nIn retrospect, Van Treeck credits much of his success to his education and experiences at SDSU, as well as mentors in his life who provided guidance along the way and his wife who provided encouragement and support.\\n\\n\"Things didn\\'t happen this way because of me, I got where I am because of people mentoring and supporting me,\" Van Treeck said. \"I feel very fortunate to have attended SDSU because my experiences and education helped me significantly throughout my entire career.\"',\n",

They escaped Europe just ahead of the Nazi hordes by promising to farm in Canada for five years. They moved to their current location in Lynden – between Hamilton and Brantford – in 1947. Today, Dave Loewith and his brother Carl are partners in the venture.\\n\\nFarming has always been a financially risky business where producers have little or no control over the final price of their products. Since 1965, however, Canadian dairy producers like the Loewiths have benefited from a system called supply management.\\n\\nThe program seeks to balance the amount of milk produced by the country’s 12,000 dairy farms with the amount processors need to meet consumer demand. By maintaining that balance, the system ensures stable prices for farmers like Loewith, ensures they don’t have to rely on government subsidies and avoids the oceans of surplus milk now washing over American farmland.\\n\\nIn 2016, Canadian farmers received an average price of 79 cents a litre, compared to 49 cents in the U.S. (Both figures are in Canadian dollars.)\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVegan non-profit prison rehabilitation charity Evolve Our Prison Farms (EOPF) is calling upon the Canadian government to reform the prison farm system to include solely plant-based agriculture.\\n\\nA recent government ruling has seen the return of dairy farms to the Canadian prison system, initially in Kingston, Ontario — a move which EOPF claims will not help to rehabilitate prisoners effectively. Back in April, founder of the initiative Calvin Neufeld told LIVEKINDLY, “teaching prisoners to exploit and slaughter animals is neither therapeutic nor rehabilitative. A plant-based model is said to teach responsibility and empathy without the exploitation of animals.”\\n\\nSince April, more details about the prison dairy farming system have been announced. It was previously thought there would be 400 goats per prison farm, this number has now risen to 1500, and 60 cows will also be added. It is also suspected that more prison farms will open outside of Kingston. “How will prisoners gain therapeutic benefits working with numbers that large, with the turnover rate that goes with it, and 2-3 kids per birth (with goats), with that many more kids sent to slaughter, and that many more grieving mothers?” Asked the organization on its Facebook page. “This is not a model of animal therapy,” it added.\\n\\nIt continued, “our government will bend over backwards to usher in a model that makes no sense while ignoring or suppressing a much simpler model [plant-based agriculture], a more ethical model, a more cost-effective and evidence-based model that makes sense from every conceivable angle.”\\n\\nThe dairy acquired from the re-opened prison farms will be shipped to China, after being processed in Kingston’s Feihe infant formula factory.\\n\\nIt is thought by some supporters of the new system that animal agriculture will bring prisoners a “real sense of personal responsibility,” said Neufeld. However, some of the inmates who will be involved in the program feel differently, in fact only just over a quarter of inmates surveyed by EOPF earlier this year agreed with the newly proposed system. “It would be nice to see a farm system based on loving kindness and not exploitation & slaughter,” said one prisoner. They added, “I personally could not be present in any area where animals are being killed.”\\n\\nTo support EOPF in its mission to stop prison dairy farms, you can march with the team, sign the EOPF petition, or contact relevant politicians.

His project focuses on utilizing sweet potatoes as a viable approach to combat Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is a major nutrition problem that could lead to blindness and weakens the immune system.

Their inclusion in daily foods would help address the Vitamin A issues. Apart from beta-carotene, sweet potatoes contain several bioactive compounds and, consequently, sweet potato inclusion in bread retards the starch digestion, which suggests prepared breads may be helpful when it comes to addressing glycemic issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nYesmin\\'s research focuses on capturing nitrates and phosphates from the runoff water using polysaccharide beads. Currently, she is developing beads composed of a variety of cations bound to alginate, food grade polysaccharide used as a viscosifier, to remove nitrates.\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause the alginate is biodegradable, Yesmin\\'s research could allow farmers to re-utilize the captured nutrient beads as fertilizer, saving them significant amounts of money.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe It\\'s All About Science Festival focuses on promoting a science-centered community by celebrating and exploring all things science, technology engineering and mathematics.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: igrow',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching Dairy Barn – home to 200 cows – has installed a state-of-the-art system that separates manure from sand bedding material, providing clean bedding for the cows and creating muck perfect for making electricity and heat.\\n\\n\\n\\nDairies also use sawdust, wood chips or straw as bedding material, but sand reduces potential bacterial growth while maximizing cow comfort, said Paul Jennette, the veterinary college’s director of biocontainment operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n“For manure management, we have to do something with all of this manure with sand in it,” said Jennette. “Pumping the sand-laden manure into a lagoon or holding tank or onto a truck is difficult, because the sand settles – not to mention the sand is abrasive on the pumps.”\\n\\n\\n\\nManure is conveyed into the new separator, adjacent to the barn. Minutes later, clean sand emerges ready for another day’s use; liquid manure is collected in a tank for removal.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe system recovers more than 95 percent of the sand for the teaching dairy to reuse. Instead of importing 30 tons of sand weekly, the dairy now only purchases new sand when needed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s how it works: A pump draws sand-laden manure out of the reception pit; it is diluted with recycled water and filtered through a screen that removes bits of hay and other debris. A high-speed pump then pushes the diluted sand and manure through a cyclone that separates most of the manure from the sand. The sand with some residual manure flows into a sand washer where an auger brings up the sand, which is then sprayed with tap water as a final cleaning step.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptured liquid manure is trucked to the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility, where microbial activity breaks down the manure – along with other organic matter – generating methane gas in the facility’s anaerobic digester, said C.J. Kilgore, chief operator of the facility.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe digester’s methane gas is then used to run microturbines to generate electricity. In turn, the turbines create heat, which is also captured. “Literally, the manure helps us to run the anaerobic digester and provide power for our facility,” Kilgore said. “We’re creating electricity and extra heat while we’re reducing our electric load.”\\n\\nSource: cornell.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Tracey Erickson\\n\\nWe often don’t focus as much on heat stress in young dairy calves and tend to focus more on cold stress. However, it is just as important and producers or calf raisers should have a plan in place to help mitigate heat stress in these animals also. Why is it important? When calves are hot they eat less under stress which affects weight gains and overall performance and health. A study by Heinrichs et al. 2005, made the association between heat stress and subsequent first lactation cows finding that the calves that underwent heat stress early in life had a higher average age at first lactation. This obviously, affects the total cost of raising a heifer and a producers’ profitability.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe thermoneutral zone is a range of temperature in which animals perform best by maintaining a constant body temperature while not expending extra energy to do so. The temperature in this zone is not affected solely by the outside temperature but can be influenced by relative humidity, air movement, moisture, hair coat, sunlight (direct vs indirect), bedding, and rumination in older calves. It is important to remember that calves can often deal with heat better than cows simply because of their larger surface area in comparison to their weight and the fact that they are producing less heat due to minimal rumination occurring. Minimal research regarding the THI (temperature humidity index) for dairy calves has been done. The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a measurement that accounts for the combined effects of environmental temperature and relative humidity. When we look at the THI levels for lactating cows mild heat stress starts occurring between 68-71 THI index and a lactating cow will experience mild to moderate stress with a 72-79 THI index. This information can be found in the Dairy Heat Stress Management and Energy Use Planning Guide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, we need to be cognizant of the observable symptoms of heat stress in young dairy animals which are the following:\\n\\nA calf’s body temperature will increase above 103 ˚F\\n\\nThere will be an increased respiration rate\\n\\nThere will be a loss of appetite\\n\\nA decrease in activity\\n\\nIf dehydration in occurring due to heat stress there will be less urine output and manure will become firmer\\n\\nThere will be increased water consumption\\n\\nProducers need to start mitigating heat stress even before the calf is born by looking to the dry cows. Keeping them cool is essential to helping maintain colostrum quality which often goes down in the summer. Thus, extra effort needs to be given to monitoring colostrum quality and possibly utilizing a colostrum replacer if necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaternity pen areas will need to be cleaned more often or if bed packs are used, fresh clean bedding added more often. With increased heat and moisture these become ideal pathogen breeding grounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a calf is born and is extremely hot, they may need to be cooled down in high THI conditions. Utilizing fans will help this situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not forget to pay attention to how the animals are being transported and arriving at the calf raising facility. Does your trailer have enough ventilation to keep the calves cool? Are calves being checked for heat stress and given proper fluids upon arrival?\\n\\n\\n\\nAre you adjusting the times at which you process calves (vaccinations and dehorning) and doing it in the cooler periods of the day? This will also decrease heat stress on the calves as well as humans.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutritionally, we need to remember a few key things with unweaned calves and heat stress. Calf starter intakes often decrease, while their energy requirements for maintenance will increase 20-30% when enduring heat stress. Thus, you will want to evaluate your milk replacer program along with considering increasing the amount times calves are fed milk or milk replacer daily from 2X/day to 3x/day. Additionally, offering smaller amounts of fresh calf starter more often will decrease spoilage and help intakes. A lot of FRESH, CLEAN, COOL WATER is an absolute must several times throughout the day if needed. Healthy calves will drink between 6 to 12 quarts of water daily and sick calves experiencing heat stress can drink up to 20 quarts of water. For more information on dehydration refer to the article, Recognizing Signs of Calf Dehydration. Additionally, you may have to extend weaning times by a week or more depending upon starter consumption during heat stress.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Fabian\\n\\nHazardous gases released from dairy manure storages during agitation can be particularly dangerous for nearby operators when gypsum bedding has been used in the cow stalls.\\n\\nGypsum recycled from manufacturing and construction waste has gained popularity as a bedding source for the dairy industry.\\n\\nIts proponents cite affordability, increased moisture absorption, low bacteria growth and soil benefits as reasons for its use.\\n\\nHowever, when gypsum — a source of sulfate — finds its way into low-oxygen manure-storage facilities via removal as soiled bedding, this innocuous product can turn into a deadly gas with a few moves of an agitation device, a dangerous threat that researchers in Penn State\\'s College of Agricultural Sciences believe can be counteracted with an additive.\\n\\n\"In agricultural production, gases near manure storages can pose severe health problems and even be lethal due to toxicity or displacing oxygen,\" said Eileen Fabian, professor of agricultural engineering. \"Tragically, the potential for gypsum bedding to have lethal consequences was not known until it was too late.\"\\n\\nFabian and Michael Hile, a postdoctoral scholar in agricultural and biological engineering, were among a team of investigators — which included experts from Penn State Extension\\'s agricultural safety program, manure haulers, farmers and industry professionals — that collected data linking gypsum-laced manure and toxic hydrogen sulfide gas levels during manure agitation in the wake of several human and cattle deaths in 2012.\\n\\nA follow-up demonstration project documented conditions on 10 dairy farms after these incidents, leading to laboratory investigations of promising manure additives that might reduce dangerous gas levels.\\n\\nAs for what causes the deadly gas, Fabian said that sulfate in manure, when placed in a virtually oxygen-free environment, can convert to hydrogen sulfide. When dairy manure in storage is agitated to mix it prior to its use as a fertilizer, the surface crust that normally forms breaks down, allowing any hydrogen sulfide gas to be released, creating a potentially toxic environment.\\n\\nHile noted that hydrogen sulfide gas \"is quite toxic, even at low levels, and can quickly overtake a person or animal, leading to unconsciousness and even death in a matter of minutes.\"\\n\\nFabian and Hile set out to prevent more tragedies by finding a way to stop the gas release. Their research involved three laboratory trials involving dairy manure additives that the duo believed potentially could counteract the effects of hydrogen sulfide — the primary additive being iron oxide. Their experiments looked at various ratios of gypsum-laced manure mixed with iron oxide, over several months of storage time.\\n\\nHydrogen sulfide concentrations were measured at agitation and between agitation events. The tests showed that adding iron oxide to gypsum-laden manure at an equivalent chemical ratio with gypsum reduced production of the gas during manure mixing to a relatively safe level.\\n\\n\"In most cases, the level of hydrogen sulfide releases was diminished to as low as the manure without gypsum,\" Fabian said. \"We continue to study this effect and share the information to prevent further tragedies to humans and livestock.\"\\n\\nAs promising as their research is, Fabian and Hile emphasized that workers in the vicinity of manure storage facilities always should put safety first, additives or not. For starters, hydrogen sulfide gas has a familiar \"rotten egg\" odor, but as Hile warned, \"This distinctive odor goes undetected at dangerous levels or after extensive exposure. Because of this, farmers should wear gas monitors that detect hydrogen sulfide concentrations to avoid dangerous conditions.\"\\n\\nThe researchers also advise workers to avoid being anywhere near the manure storage during agitation, and to consider the impact on occupants of nearby surroundings, especially children who are at increased risk because the gas is typically at higher concentrations close to the ground.\\n\\nOperators positioned above surrounding topography and at a distance from the storage are at reduced risk for experiencing dangerous gas levels versus operators positioned nearby at ground level. Another suggestion — operators should be positioned upwind.\\n\\n\"The bottom line is that the benefit of gypsum cow bedding and agronomic values must be balanced against the potential gas hazard,\" Fabian said. \"If gypsum is used, safeguards must be put in place to prevent the potential harm it might cause.\"\\n\\nAiding in the research, which was published recently in Transactions of the ASABE (American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers), were Long Chen, doctoral student in agricultural and biological engineering; Mary Ann Bruns, associate professor of soil microbiology and biogeochemistry; Zhanxiong Xu, doctoral student in statistics, Eberly College of Science; and Vance Brown, technical manager, Smithfield Premium Genetics.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided funding for the research.',\n",

This shift has created some tension with the U.S.\\n\\nIf Canada accepts the U.S. demands and eliminates class 7, the outcomes could negatively affect domestic dairy farmers.\\n\\nProducers would face the “challenge of finding a home for the excess skim products in Canada,” Mussel said.\\n\\nWhile producers could re-route some skim milk powder through class 4M for animal feed, they would earn a significantly lower price – an estimated 10 per cent of the world market price – for their products, Mussell said.\\n\\nAlternatively, the country would “have to make major quota cutbacks to try and get the skim market to balance domestically,” he said.\\n\\nBy eliminating the supply management system, Canadian producers may end up in the same situation as farmers facing overproduction in other dairy-exporting countries, like the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and members of the European Union, the note said. These countries adopted alternative policy instruments to stabilize production but they were not successful.\\n\\nCanadian policies are not the culprit of these countries’ surpluses, the note explained.\\n\\n“World dairy markets are some of the most distorted markets in agricultural trade,” the note said. “All of the major dairy exporters have been suffering from overproduction. These issues … would have existed regardless of Canada.”\\n\\nRonnie Chua/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Mark Thomas\\n\\n\\n\\nMany times, as veterinarians and cow health caregivers, we strive to do what we think is in the best interest of the calf or cow we are treating. On some farms a treatment is administered at the slightest sign of a possible illness. Often antibiotics are included in this treatment. We are also focused on the prevention of disease through good management and vaccination programs. However, all too often we realize vaccination protocols have turned our cows into pin cushions. Are all of these vaccines warranted?\\n\\n\\n\\nREDUCED ANTIBIOTIC USE\\n\\nWith the implementation of the veterinary feed directive (VFD) and increased consumer pressure to reduce antimicrobial use, we have been challenged in a good way to review the common practices of disease treatment and prevention. The routine use of antimicrobials in milk replacers and calf starter feeds are one example where we have effectively reduced antimicrobial use with little to no negative consequences. Continued research and the early adoption of selective dry cow therapy is another area of significant promise in not only the reduction of antimicrobial use but also the reduction in labor and drug costs for a dairy operation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we continue to gain information through research projects and implementation of updated treatment protocols, there has been a greater realization that perhaps some of the common treatments we administer might actually be neutral or even detrimental. Think of the evolution of certain treatments, such as uterine infusions, which were very commonplace but are rarely performed today. We have used research trials to measure the important outcomes and edit our treatment protocols based on this information.\\n\\n\\n\\nSHOULD WE SAVE EVERY COW OR CALF?\\n\\nThere has also been a major shift to not try and save every cow or calf. Early identification and removal of an animal that has a very poor prognosis is a win-win. It is improved welfare for the animal in question and is generally the most economical decision if the animal can be slaughtered versus removal after death. Extended treatments only create increased residue risks and more labor for the farm staff. This is an excellent place to use your herd veterinarian for second opinion examinations. Do we have a case worth continuing treatment? Is the diagnosis and treatment correct? When is it time for either humane slaughter or euthanasia?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe regulations around pharmaceutical use, especially antibiotics, will continue to evolve and become more stringent. Again, these challenges are not all bad as they cause us to think out of the box, improve management and not always reach for a syringe to “cure” a problem. Organizations such as the American Association of Bovine Practitioners have been active on the legislative side to preserve the use of necessary antibiotics for livestock use while we concurrently work toward more prudent use.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs with all things, it is a balance. This balance can only be created with an openness to change and by putting available data to use, not subjective evaluation, for our prevention and treatment programs.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: udel.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Issue\\n\\n2018 is turning out to be a time of tension, and potentially high drama in Canadian trade policy.\\n\\nThere has been a rapid escalation of tensions into what may prove to be a trade war between the US and\\n\\nCanada (and between the US and others) over the US use of Section 232 tariffs, while Canada is in\\n\\nnegotiations with the US and Mexico on renewal of NAFTA (since July 2017). Consistent with the\\n\\nMexican presidential elections and US Congressional mid-term elections, NAFTA renewal negotiations\\n\\nappear to have fallen back into stock taking and planning. However, this has not impacted the\\n\\nrhetoric, and the US continues to threaten further escalation under Section 232 tariffs, or otherwise.\\n\\nWhile mostly directed at China, further escalation may be seen as a tool through which to leverage\\n\\nNAFTA renegotiation with Canada.\\n\\nIn this regard, the US has particularly directed its comments at Canadian dairy. US President Trump\\n\\nhas decried 270 percent tariffs he says that Canada charges on dairy imports from the US. More recently,\\n\\nUS Undersecretary for Agricultural Trade Ted McKinney was quoted as saying\\n\\n“You [Canada]… decided to dump dried milk powder on the world market at half to two-thirds of world\\n\\nprice … Not fair. Not fair”1\\n\\nThis could present the motivation for Canada to accommodate US demands for major changes in\\n\\nCanadian dairy policy. Reportedly, the US has requested the removal of milk Class 7, along with a\\n\\nphase out of supply management over 10 years. The Government of Canada has expressed its commitment\\n\\nto defend supply management; yet, it cannot ignore the high stakes to other segments in the event of an\\n\\nimpasse over Canadian dairy policy. Moreover, the need to placate and constantly defend dairy policy in\\n\\nforeign relations is an obligation for the federal government; the 11th hour short strokes toward a\\n\\nrenegotiated NAFTA agreement could provide just the crisis that could release the government from this\\n\\nburden. Concessions to the US on dairy could be seen by some as an opportunity to provide President\\n\\nTrump with a quick win.\\n\\nHowever plausible, this would be naïve. The dichotomy portrayed between a protected dairy\\n\\nmarket with a coddled dairy industry versus US free traders south of the border and elsewhere is a false\\n\\none, and would leave Canada exposed to competition with others who are anything but free traders. The\\n\\nreal question then is what Canada’s fallback position is if it were to make major concessions that weakened\\n\\nor somehow eliminated supply management.\\n\\nThe purpose of this policy note is to consider the context and implications of Canada making major\\n\\nchanges in its dairy policy as an element in concluding a new NAFTA agreement.\\n\\nWhat the US Wants\\n\\nMedia outlets reported on requests that the US had made of Canada with respect to dairy under NAFTA\\n\\nrenegotiation round in mid-October 2017. The requests made of Canada reported at that time were\\n\\nthe following:\\n\\n>Increased transparency regarding the operation of milk supply management\\n\\n>Elimination of milk Class 3(d), Class 5, and Class 7\\n\\n>US prior agreement to any changes in milk supply management\\n\\n>A phase-out of supply management through elimination of supply control/quotas in dairy,\\n\\npoultry, and eggs within 10 years\\n\\n>Increased dairy market access of 5% per yearleading to open access for the US within 10\\n\\nyears\\n\\n>Apparently more specific US requests regarding Canadian dairy market access, to be\\n\\nclarified. One media outlet reported that the US had requested access for 400,000 tonnes of\\n\\nfluid milk (vs. 55,000 tonnes agreed to in the original TPP agreement).\\n\\nThese requests from the US should be interpreted with some caution, as they were made prior to the\\n\\nSenate confirmation of the lead US agricultural trade negotiator; some requests were rejected out of hand\\n\\nby Canada as unworkable. However, with Greg Doud now confirmed as US lead agricultural trade\\n\\nnegotiator it can be anticipated that the US will now press its demands further, and press for a Canadian\\n\\nresponse.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Two years ago, first-generation farmer Jon Lucas moved his family and 150 milking cows and young stock to Orwell, Vermont, to lease the hillside land.\\n\\nIn the valley below their farm sits a rustic wooden barn. Its roof, tiled with the faded date of construction, “1880,” reveals the rich history of this lakeside landscape. In the 138 years since the barn’s construction, multiple generations of farmers tended this valley to keep it in agriculture. Inclement weather combined with the county’s compactable clay soils have made farming in this valley a challenge. Despite challenges, Jon demonstrates that farming with conservation practices can reduce the region’s impact on water quality and protect this beautiful landscape's natural resources.\\n\\nThe dairy is nestled within Vermont’s East Creek Watershed. Water that lands within this area eventually flows into Lake Champlain, depositing nutrients and chemicals picked up along its journey. Of the approximately 20,500 acres located in the watershed, half of it is still in agriculture. As a result, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service made this region a priority focus area to help reduce phosphorus runoff from agriculture and improve water quality. USDA NRCS and partners are devoting financial and technical assistance to farmers and landowners in East Creek Watershed and to help meet the state’s nutrient reduction strategy. NRCS works one-on-one with farmers like the Lucas’ to identify areas of nutrient loading and apply conservation practices on their land.\\n\\nBut, this system doesn’t come without its challenges. Some obstacles include extreme rain and clay soils. Compared to other soil compositions, soils with predominately fine, clay particles are stickier, leaving little room for water movement. The tiny pore spaces between soil particles are easily compacted, which makes it difficult for plants to uptake water and nutrients and for no till machinery to work the soil.\\n\\nVermont farmer Jon Lucas (left) shows NRCS Soil Conservationist George Tucker the no till corn planter that he has modified.\\n\\nGeorge Tucker, a NRCS soil conservationist who assists Jon, compares the difficulty of working with compacted clay soils to going to the beach and trying to stick your fingers in the sand versus dragging them through pavement. Imagine a plant root also attempting to travel through that pavement.\\n\\nJon designs his farming system to work with nature and applies conservation practices, such as no-till and cover crops to improve soil health and reduce his impact on water quality. Adaptive land stewards like Jon understand how to adjust their conservation practices to work with the region’s challenges, including inclement weather and compactable clay soils.\\n\\nJon kept at it last spring, when heavy rains delayed corn planting until early June. While some farmers followed convention, Jon adapted, working with Mother Nature. His plan included implementing reduced tillage and planting sorghum, an annual grass that can handle wetter conditions and be used as an alternate source of silage.\\n\\nIt isn’t simple to try new practices or plant new crops, as there are risks involved. But, Jon is determined and his perspective on trying new methods sums it up. “If you tried no-till for the first time last year, you were going to have a poor crop whether you implemented no-till or not. You can’t walk into it assuming it is pass or fail. There are so many variables that figure into whether a practice will work or not. You have to try it differently, each year. You have to keep adjusting your strategy and talking to other farmers.”\\n\\nJon credits NRCS’ assistance for helping him implement the practices. He explains that when he gets a loan from the bank, the money “will often go towards increasing milk production, so NRCS’ targeted assistance is especially beneficial for applying practices specifically for conservation.”\\n\\nThe Lucas family represents the next cohort of farm families to take responsibility for the care of this lakeside landscape and its resources. In partnership with NRCS, farmers like Jon will implement innovative conservation practices that protect Vermont’s soil and water quality for future generations.\\n\\nVisit the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for assistance with improving water quality on your land.\\n\\nJon has worked with NRCS through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to protect soil and water quality through practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage and no till.\",\n",

Texas leads the nation in sheep, goat and cattle production with over 94M head of cattle alone. Even with this strong representation, landowners often mix livestock production and wildlife management on the same property. Other landowners now primarily manage for wildlife on an additional 3.3M acres which helps maintain ecological functions of the state’s grasslands and forests. Given the preponderance of livestock and growing interest in wildlife management, it’s easy to understand why grazing management is essential for sustaining and improving open lands in Texas.\\n\\n\\n\\nTexas A&M AgriLife Extension Service (Agrilife) is working to reach landowners and managers in innovative ways, and we created a number of free mobile apps to assist in land, wildlife and livestock management decisions. While there are a number of apps available, AgriLife’s Cow Poop Analyzer and the Stocking Rate Calculator for Grazing Livestock apps are two valuable tools when it comes to how cattle are responding to food sources and how many head to stock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cow Poop Analyzer app can be used to monitor crude protein and digestibility of forage that cattle are grazing. This app allows the user to take pictures of a manure pile and then cross reference the photo to other photos of manure with known forage quality descriptions. Each new record is then tied back to a particular pasture and time of year so that forage quality can be monitored over time.\\n\\n\\n\\nMatching forage quality with the nutritional requirements of cattle at different times of the year will allow livestock managers to know when forage quality is adequate, how to utilize available forage more efficiently, and when supplemental feed may be needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Chris Hurt\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural Economics\\n\\nPurdue University\\n\\nThe pork industry appears to be headed for a period of large losses in which excess pork supplies force prices below costs of production. In addition, demand will likely be weakened by reduced exports with tariffs in place on U.S. pork exports to China and Mexico. On a positive note, Chinese tariffs on U.S. grains and soybeans are helping to erode feed prices along with favorable growing season weather.\\n\\nThe industry has expanded the breeding herd by three percent according to a recent producer survey by USDA. This is the highest rate of breeding herd expansion since this expansion phase began in 2015. A breeding herd of this magnitude is likely to be a primary contributor to excess supplies in 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nThe market herd was up three percent and farrowing intentions for this summer and fall were up two percent. With the breeding herd up three percent, there is concern that actual farrowings this summer and fall could be higher than the two percent increase recorded by survey respondents.\\n\\nPork supplies will be large. First-half supplies this year have been up four percent and are expected to rise to five percent higher in the third quarter this summer and four percent higher in the final quarter of 2018. Current expected supplies for the first-half of 2019 are up four percent and three percent in the last-half of 2019.\\n\\nThe second driver of the large losses facing the pork industry revolve around the current trade war the U.S. has entered. The U.S. pork industry has done an amazing job of producing low costs and high value pork products and adapting them to our foreign customers. As a result we have targeted exports as a strategic objective to grow the U.S. pork industry. Our success in growing exports to 22 percent of production means that pork became a target of both China and Mexico.\\n\\nPork exports started the year with a lot of promise being up nine percent at the end of April compared to the January to April period last year. Chinese tariffs on U.S. pork began on April 2 and were raised again on July 6 making additional tariffs of at least 50 percent. Mexico placed tariffs on U.S. pork of ten percent on June 5, and raised those to 20 percent on July 5.\\n\\nWeekly export data from USDA suggests a sharp drop in pork export sales during the month of June representing about a 25 percent decrease from last year. Weakness in exports will be expected as long as the tariffs stay in place. China has also placed tariffs on U.S. beef and poultry which may reduce U.S. exports of these competitive meats.\\n\\nJust how large are the loss prospects right now considering the large pork supplies, reduced exports due to tariffs, and reduced feed prices due to tariffs and favorable growing conditions?\\n\\nLiveweight prices for 51-52 percent lean carcasses are expected to average about $49 in the third quarter of 2018 before dropping sharply in the last quarter to near $40. Current estimates of cost of production are near $50.\\n\\nIn 2019, prices are expected to be below costs for much of the year. Liveweight prices are expected to be in the low $40’s in the first quarter and then move to near $50 for averages in the second and third quarter before dropping back to the low $40’s for the final quarter.\\n\\nEstimated losses are expected to be large this fall and winter with losses averaging about $25 per head for this six month period. Hog prices may be close to breakeven in the second and third quarters before returning to losses greater than $20 per head in the last quarter of 2019. Losses for the calendar year of 2018 are estimated at a loss of $10 per head and $12 per head of loss in 2019.\\n\\nFeed costs are expected to be somewhat lower in the second-half of 2018 versus the first-half. This is especially true for soybean meal where Decatur, Illinois prices for high protein meal were near $365 per ton in the first-half. That same price in the second-half is expected to be closer to $340 per ton. Unfortunately, corn costs may be similar in both halves of the year and thus the modestly lower feed costs are not enough to offset low hog prices.\\n\\nMy prices for hogs and feed are primarily based on futures prices on July 9. Clearly, agricultural product markets are in a period of high uncertainty and volatility. Weather will continue to be a driver of crop prices over the next six to eight weeks. What happens to tariffs on U.S. exports of crops and animal products will also add dynamic price potential.\\n\\nGiven the heightened level of uncertainty, most pork producers will not want to make long-term decisions at this point. That means carrying on as best they can with short-term plans. The current trade war that agriculture has been unwillingly forced to participate in has an unknown and difficult to predict outcome. Only time will help bring the “end game” into better focus.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Kris Ringwall, Beef Specialist\\n\\nThe business success of beef enterprises often suffers because two questions are not evaluated regularly.\\n\\nFirst, how much does the average beef producer have invested in the cattle operation? Second, can a producer get a fair market return on that investment?\\n\\nSome families accept a negative return because the “way of life” is a benefit. Still, good business practices will enhance the “way of life” benefit.\\n\\nSo let us look at the dollars and cents of the cow-calf business, keeping in mind that the business really does not have an average cow-calf person. The reasons, the “whys,” and the ultimate end desires vary more than we have words to describe. Perhaps that is why these discussions often evolve around the word “commodity.”\\n\\nCommodity beef production focuses on prices, assuming the greater the price, the bigger the check, thus more positive the outcomes. However, expenses play a key role in what remains of the beef check.\\n\\nThe beef industry enjoyed high prices a few years ago. Today, some leveling has occurred in the current beef producer’s expectations of the market, leading to renewed interest in keeping costs under control.\\n\\nWith no upper or lower limits to price, managerial commitment to control costs is imperative, so let us look at current costs. A review of FINBIN (https://finbin.umn.edu/) from the Center for Farm Financial Management, University of Minnesota, really helps get a handle on dollars.\\n\\nThe problem inherent to any data set is how relevant are those herds that submit data. Unfortunately, data sets are hard to establish, and those that exist are good. I just wish more herds would participate. Or more deeply, the wish is that more herds would have the data to participate. However, we use the data available.\\n\\nLet us review North Dakota FINBIN numbers for cow-calf enterprise costs from 2007, 2008 and 2009 (the early years) with years 2015, 2016 and 2017 (the recent years). Total feed cost per cow was $279 in 2007, $289 in 2008 and $303 in 2009, or a three-year average of $290. Total feed cost per cow was $355 in 2015, $349 in 2016 and $367 in 2017, or a three-year average for the recent years of $357. This is an increase of 123 percent, or $67 per cow.\\n\\nThe next largest cost would be the replacement of breeding cows. The average cost to purchase or transfer in replacement heifers per cow in the herd was $143 in 2007, $141 in 2008 and $172 in 2009, for an average of $152. The same costs were $371 in 2015, $261 in 2016 and $228 in 2017, for an average of $287. This is an increase of 189 percent, or $135 per cow in the herd.\\n\\nAdditional direct costs (veterinary services, supplies, fuel and oil, repairs, custom hiring, marketing and operating interest) are calculated by subtracting the total feed cost from the total direct cost. FINBIN data show additional direct costs were $91 ($370 minus $279) in 2007, $100 ($389 minus $289) in 2008 and $95 ($398 minus $303) in 2009, for a three-year average of $95. Additional direct costs were $141 ($496 minus $355) in 2015, $110 ($459 minus $349) in 2016 and $139 ($506 minus $367) in 2017, for a three-year average of $130. The additional direct costs increased 137 percent, or $35 per cow.\\n\\nIn reality, costs continue to rise, marketable production remains stagnant and prices have leveled. Yet, the current response to staying in the cow-calf business is similar to previous responses. Producers generally focus on the market price of calves, promptly noting if a change in market direction occurs.\\n\\nThe actual cow-calf costs are generally not part of the equation. As the record prices of previous years are put in the history books, today’s backgrounders and feedlot owners will buy calves at a price based on potential market indicators and the ability to profit, as well as seek a positive return on investment. They will continue to project income and subtract expenses while managing grass calves or feedlot calves.\\n\\nBreak-even prices will be calculated based on the costs associated with the cattle-feeding operation. In theory, supply and demand will negotiate the final price that a grass or feedlot manager will offer to cow-calf producers.\\n\\nOnce the final purchase is settled, feedlots will manage cattle so carcass quantity and quality will maximize the cattle-feeding operation’s capacity to offset costs. Feedlots will revisit costs and adjust costs and the price of incoming cattle to manage expected returns.\\n\\nUltimately, understanding consumer demand factors into the equation. So what can the cow-calf producer do? The cow-calf producer needs to know input costs to help determine break-even prices and, more importantly, realize some profit and an acceptable return on investment.\\n\\nAverage expenses are up 144 percent. Good business practices, associated data and marketing skills need to be the cornerstone of the cow-calf operation. Then implement tight cost controls for a return on the investment.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Friday, the US Department of Agriculture will release in tandem both the monthly Cattle on Feed Report as well as the Midyear Cattle Inventory Report. Dr. Lee Schulz of Iowa State University offered a brief pre-report analysis of the industry’s expectations for the data in these reports and he suspects that as is often the case with these reports, all eyes will be primarily on the number of placements recorded.\\n\\n“I think they’re expected above a year ago. We’ve seen larger feeder cattle imports from Mexico and Canada and really stronger feeder cattle receipt activity,” he said. “So, I think we’re seeing those cattle enter feedlots. Some of that is weather related and dry conditions in some areas is pushing it into the feedlot at somewhat lighter weights.”\\n\\nRegarding cattle marketed, Schulz believes the industry will be at roughly year-ago levels, mostly due to June having one less slaughter day this year, which he estimates will bring the total cattle on feed number to around 4 or 5 percent above a year ago. He notes that if any surprises were to come from this report, it would be in that placement number which he adds has thrown some analysts for a loop over the last few months. The results of this report cycle, he thinks will be somewhat bearish - not for the current market - but, rather deferred markets. And with herd expansion noticeably slowing, Schulz says he wonders just at how fast a rate it actually is decelerating or even all but stopped at this point. He says the Midyear Inventory report will offer a glimpse at the larger picture of this cattle market at present and how it will develop over the balance of the year.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Their findings are published this week in Science Advances.\\n\\n\"China\\'s livestock transition is massive, in terms of its scale and speed,\" says Zhaohai Bai, an Associate Professor at the Center for Agricultural Resources Research in the Institute of Genetic and Developmental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the team\\'s lead author.\\n\\nBai notes how the \"Livestock Revolution\" has been compared with the better known \"Green Revolution\" in cereals production, with the market value of the global increases in meat and milk consumption between 1970 and 1990 being twice that of wheat, rice and corn.\\n\\nIn China, the average meat, milk and egg consumption per capita increased by 3.9, 10 and 6.9 times from 1980 to 2010, more than anywhere else in the world. The livestock population grew from 142 to 441 million animals over the period, lifting the sector\\'s economic value almost 60-fold, and China became the world\\'s biggest livestock producer, ahead of the US and Europe.\\n\\nAt the farm level, the proportion of more nutrient efficient monogastric animals (pigs and poultry rather than ruminant animals, cattle and sheep) rose from 62% to 74%, and the number of landless (housed) industrial systems, which reduce the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (at a product intensity level, or GHG emissions per unit of product) but limit sustainable production, rose 70-fold.\\n\\n\"However, the costs of livestock transition are also large,\" says Lin Ma, the paper\\'s corresponding author, also at the CAS institute. \"Animal feed imports have increased 49 times, total ammonia and GHG emissions to the atmosphere doubled, and nitrogen losses to watercourses tripled,\" he adds.\\n\\nWeak environmental standards, deregulation policies and subsidies, as high as Yuan 10 billion (£1 billion) a year since 2007, are blamed. \"This new transition must be induced by government, processing industry, consumers and retailers,\" stresses Ma.\\n\\nThe team, which also includes scientists from Rothamsted Research and University of Bristol in the UK, IIASA in Austria, Wageningen University in the Netherlands, as well as Agricultural University of Hebei and China Agriculture University, has explored two contrasting scenarios to 2050: a business-as-usual model and the new transition supported by stakeholders.\\n\\nWithout change, there will be even greater increases in emissions of GHGs and ammonia, and in losses of nitrogen to watercourses. With change, GHG emissions can be cut by almost half and nitrogen losses by nearly two thirds.\\n\\n\"China\\'s livestock transition has significant global impact and there is critical need to develop pathways for more sustainable livestock production as we face growing pressure on resources and environmental consequences of global agriculture,\" says Michael Lee, Head of Rothamsted\\'s North Wyke site and one of the paper\\'s authors.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Chris Penrose\\n\\nAs I drove around Morgan County in late June and even on my farm, there was still a lot of hay to make. Stems and seed heads on orchardgrass and fescue had turned brown and the quality was poor. We still have a great and inexpensive option for quality forages this fall and winter, and without much effort or cost: stockpiling pastures and even hayfields for grazing.\\n\\nAfter feeding corn stalks, probably the lowest cost way to feed cattle in the fall and winter is to stockpile forages. Stockpiling means to make the last harvest by clipping or grazing of a hay field or pasture and then let it grow for grazing latter; in this situation, in the fall or winter. While most predominantly cool season grass based fields will work, fescue works the best as it maintains quality into and throughout the winter better. Many studies have demonstrated that one way to improve the quality and yield is to apply nitrogen (N) when stockpiling is initiated. Urea is the most common form of N used for stockpiling in most areas, but the biggest risk is applying the urea, then not getting a rain allowing much of the nitrogen to be lost by evaporating (volatilizing) in warm, dry conditions before it has a chance to react with the soil.\\n\\nOne product available to reduce nitrogen loss is Agrotain®, a urease inhibitor. Several universities have done research on urease inhibitors and the University of Kentucky has an excellent factsheet on Nitrogen Inhibitors (http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/agr/agr185/agr185.pdf).\\n\\nIn Southeast Ohio, studies and demonstrations have been conducted to evaluate quality and quantity of stockpiling cool season grasses such as fescue with no nitrogen (N), 100# of urea (46# N), 100# of urea with Agrotain®, and 218# of ammonium sulfate per acre (all treatments were 46# N per acre). We are in the third year of this study. Last year, we started the study July 31 and harvested the plots November 13. Plots with no N averaged 1781# of dry matter per acre, and the plots with N added ranged from 2757 to 3244# of dry matter per acre. Crude protein was also slightly higher when N was added for stockpiling (crude protein averaged 12.06% for the control plots and 12.26-12.91% when N was added). The one thing we can say at this point is that we get a yield and quality response when we add nitrogen. From a cost standpoint, urea is much less expensive than ammonium sulfate.\\n\\nAnother fertilizer option for stockpiling that was not used in these trials is 18-46-0 or DAP. In areas of Southeast Ohio where phosphorus levels are very low in pastures and hayfields, this can be an option and the nitrogen in this fertilizer is more stable than urea.\\n\\nSo, what do I recommend? As a farmer and an Extension Educator, I recommend stockpiling cool season grasses to reduce our need for stored forages. It can save money and definitely save time.\\n\\nI have been involved on and off with these studies for thirty years and also practicing this on my farm as well, and my conclusions are the earlier you begin stockpiling, the higher the yield and lower the quality. The later you begin stockpiling, the lower the yield and higher the quality. Quality and yield will go down the later you begin grazing.\\n\\nOn my farm, I keep a stockpiled field until March when my cows start calving and they really like the stockpiled grass, however I am seeing more deer grazing pressure waiting that long to graze in that field. Finally, adding N will increase yield and quality. If you have some pastures or even hay fields that you could set aside for fall and winter grazing, between now and mid-August would be a great time to start. In many situations, it may be the best winter forages we will have.',\n",

Slaughter will continue to have year-over-year increases but the year-over-year increases will be smaller. September slaughter will likely be smaller than July. Live weights are up on average for 2018 almost 6 pounds. Beef production was previously anticipated to be up approximately 3.7% but the year-to-date increase will be closer to 4%. First quarter beef production was up 2.6% from 2017, whereas second quarter beef production was up just over 5%.\\n\\n\\n\\nCash market prices topped out for the year in February when the weekly 5-market average was $129.75 per cwt. (live basis) and prices eroded only to rebound slightly in May to $124.81. By the last week of June the price had fallen to $106.87 per cwt. In the half of this year, the 5-market price was 8.3% below 2017’s. The first quarter of 2018 saw prices that were 2.8% above 2017, but April-June prices have been 12% below the same 2017 time period. Given the expected increase in beef production, prices were anticipated to be lower in 2018. Where prices go from here will depend a lot on the trade situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrade with China currently dominates the market news; and from an agricultural perspective, it is a daunting situation. April saw tariff increases on US pork and soybeans, and effective July 6, China’s duty rate on US beef went from 12% to 37%. Note that Australia faces only a 7.2% duty on their beef. Should the US be concerned about the tariff: yes, but the futures market likely overcompensated last week. Approximately 16% of our beef and veal exports went to Taiwan/Hong Kong in 2017; mainland China took less than 1%. This increased tariff will likely make it difficult to promote US beef in China, especially since it is already priced at a premium to other imports. US beef producers need to be concerned though about the 25% tariff implemented by China on US pork products.\\n\\n\\n\\nApril 2018 saw a 25% tariff on US pork to China. Since April pork exports to China are well below 2017 levels. May 2018 saw a 31% decline in pork exports to China and Hong Kong. Given that the US exports about 23% of their pork production, of which mainland China/Hong Kong account for about 11% of our exports this tariff increase will likely bring even more US pork on domestic retail shelves this fall, further creating price pressure for beef. Additionally, pork production typically peaks in the 4th quarter and this year will see record pork production.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere will prices go? Prior to any trade war, expectations were that finished cattle prices would be approximately 5% lower in 2018 than 2017. Given the current trade situation, lower wholesale beef prices, and large pork production prices may dip even lower but the year-over-year decreases should not be at the levels seen in the second quarter of 2018. The markets should correct themselves for the overreaction last week. Packers still have profitability and cash trade will strengthen soon and going into fall. Nonetheless year-over-year decreases in prices will likely be in the 5-6% lower given the large number of cattle.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: osu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Dr. Kenny Burdine\\n\\n\\n\\nI always like to see the fed cattle market put in its summer lows and there are some indications that this has already happened for 2018. August CME© Fed Cattle Futures have rallied from late May and deferred futures are trading at a premium to August. Kentucky feeder cattle markets were relatively flat from May to June. Heavy feeder prices in Kentucky were basically unchanged over the last two months, but it was very encouraging that they held the ground they gained after April (see figure 1).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalf prices decreased slightly, but that is very much in line with seasonal expectations. A quick visual comparison of 2018, to the longer term average in figure 2, would suggest that our calf price pattern in 2018 is pretty normal. Calf prices are $15 to $20 per cwt lower this year, but much of that is due to the extremely high price levels of 2014 and 2015 pulling that longer term average upward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I write this article (July 11, 2018), international trade seems to be the topic of discussion most everywhere I turn. Many people want to know the likely impact of tariffs that have been, or may soon be, imposed on US beef. So, I thought it might be worth a quick dive into the topic to put some of the discussion into perspective.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will start with the basics and keep it pretty simple. A tariff is a tax on imports that is imposed by the importing country. We can discuss the United States and Canada, since that is the most recent example. Canada has imposed a tariff on imported beef from the US. Due to the tariff, the price of US beef increases in Canada. Because the price rises, less US beef is imported by Canada, which means that more beef will be on the US market. And, because more beef is left on the US market, beef prices in the US will decrease.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, the picture becomes less clear when one starts to think about the potential magnitude of this price impact and this is where I want to spend some time looking at the numbers. Like many agricultural sectors, exports have a major impact on the US beef market. As can be seen at the bottom of table 1, the US exported nearly 11% of its beef production in 2017. While this is definitely significant, the beef sector is actually less export-dependent than pork or poultry, which export 22% and 16%, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, as we start thinking about impacts from tariffs imposed by specific countries, we also need to think about how much beef actually flows to that specific country. Table 1 shows US beef exports to our largest five export destinations (Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Hong Kong, and Canada) for 2017. Note that Japan is the largest importer of US beef, accounting for 28.9% of our total exports. However, because most US beef is consumed domestically, this still only represents a little over 3% of our total production.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, we will consider the recent Canadian tariff on US beef. As can be seen in table 1, over 300 million lbs of beef were exported to Canada in 2017. However, this only represented 1.2% of total US beef production. So, even if exports to Canada decreased by 25%, which would be a very large response, domestic supply would only increase by about 0.3%. Similarly, there has also been a lot of discussion about China recently, but China remains a very small importer of US beef at this time. Hopefully, table 1 provides some perspective on how dependent the US beef sector is on specific export markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1. 2017 US Beef Exports to Selected Countries\\n\\nSource: USDA-ERS, Livestock Marketing Information Center, Author Calculations\\n\\nExports, Carcass wt equivalent (1,000 lbs) As % of US Beef Exports As % of US Beef Production Japan 826,004 28.9% 3.2% South Korea 472,729 16.5% 1.8% Mexico 419,349 14.7% 1.6% Hong Kong 335,705 11.7% 1.3% Canada 309,138 10.8% 1.2% Total Exports (includes others) 2,859,687 10.92%\\n\\nSource: USDA-ERS, Livestock Marketing Information Center, Author Calculations\\n\\n\\n\\nSince our export markets are pretty diverse, the direct impact of tariffs imposed on US beef by any specific trading partner are not likely to have a large impact on the cattle market. Still, the culmination of tariffs by multiple trading partners does have more potential to impact prices. At the same time, tariffs on other meat products also have the potential to impact beef markets. China and Mexico both have levied tariffs on US pork, which will negatively impact US pork prices. Due to the substitution effect, beef prices will be negatively impacted as pork becomes a relatively cheaper source of protein.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy article in May primarily focused on beef production levels and the challenges that is presenting. I wanted to shift the focus to trade this month and it has proven to be a very timely month to do so. Clearly, trade remains another challenges, but I also think that the diversity of our markets will buffer the impacts on beef producers somewhat. There is never a shortage of factors driving the markets and one can only focus on those things that are within their control.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: osu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer heat takes its toll on your entire herd, with a decrease in performance, the potential for increased sickness and economic losses. But for stocker calves, in their prime growth period, the added stress from heat can magnify those challenges even more so.\\n\\nThe degree of heat stress is typically measured by a temperature-humidity index (THI) and this threshold varies based on the production stage of the animal. For stockers the threshold THI for moderate stress is about 84-degrees, where it might be about 5 degrees lower for a lactating cow. The duration of extreme temperatures also plays a role in the way heat stress impacts stockers. Therefore, there is no one size fits all approach to solving the heat-stress challenges.\\n\\n“The unfortunate part is everybody’s situation is different based on regional climate differences,” said Kevin Glaubius, Director of Nutrition for BioZyme® Inc. “Where a backgrounder in Texas might have to deal with severe heat for seven months, someone in North Dakota might have extreme heat for just two months. However, the commonality is understanding the cascade of events that go on with heat stress – symptoms to look for and what to do.”\\n\\nThe first visible sign of heat stress you should look for is an increased respiration rate. According to Glaubius, this increased respiration leads to increased air volume intake, which can ultimately lead to other sicknesses in the calves. With increased air intake, the calves are inhaling more dust, dirt, bacteria and viruses into their bodies.\\n\\nThe second sign of heat stress, and one most commonly thought of, is calves that seek out shade and water during the heat of the day. This disrupts the normal feeding pattern of continuously grazing and consuming smaller meals. That disruption shifts to night grazing and slug feeding where they eat more at once due to increased hunger. Slug feeding leads to acidosis and bloat, which can lead to more health issues. When they bunch up during the day, they also are more likely to be exposed to sickness because of shared germs – think of containing school kids in an enclosed room with no fresh air.\\n\\n“Metabolically, the cells are working harder, when the calves’ respiration increases, so those cells have to be replaced more often. Microbes have a life cycle of minutes – maybe 90 minutes – so disruption of eating during the day starves the microbes from their growth pattern, which is why this is a great time to introduce a prebiotic like Amaferm® into the calves’ diets,” Glaubius said.\\n\\nAmaferm is a precision prebiotic designed to enhance digestibility by amplifying the nutrient supply within for maximum performance. It is research-proven to maintain the animal’s body temperature due to heat. Feeding Amaferm?during heat stress has multiple benefits including improved digestibility, increased energy availability, improved rumen function, and less loss of performance. The improved digestibility observed with Amaferm?feeding provides more energy to the animal during heat stress when intake is reduced.\\n\\nIn ideal conditions, when heat stress isn’t a challenge, and voluntary feed intake exists, Glaubius said typically 70-percent of the diet goes toward maintenance while 30-percent will go to gain. During times of extreme heat, those numbers change, and 80-percent of intake goes toward maintenance, and only 20-percent goes to gain, costing the stocker operator lost performance over time.\\n\\nThat’s why it is imperative to keep your calves as cool as possible and regulate their grazing habits, keeping them eating regularly and performing. Glaubius offers suggestions for caring for stockers during the hot summer months.\\n\\n- If you do need to work or treat any sick calves, do so early in the day when the temperatures are the coolest.\\n\\n- Any physical exercise like moving calves from pasture to pasture, needs to be done in the early morning during the coolest part of the day.\\n\\n- Provide adequate shade. If trees are available great. If you are feeding small groups of calves, consider portable shade options or build your own shade options if in pastures or lots you use each year.\\n\\n- Provide cool, fresh water. Water intake is directly correlated to feed intake. If your calves only water source is a pond where the calves are bunching to stay cool, consider putting in a tank with fresh well water flow so the calves get fresh water that they haven’t stood in.\\n\\n- Provide a high-quality vitamin and mineral supplement like VitaFerm® Gain Smart® Stocker HEAT® to keep the calves healthy, cooler and growing.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Careful management can ensure healthy pastures during hot, dry summers\\n\\nFescue ceases growth during hot conditions, Philipp said. “During those times, fescue should not be mowed or grazed to avoid damage to the sward.”\\n\\nIf producers decide to cut fescue for hay under these conditions, Philipp said, they should leave at least 4 inches of leaf material on the plants to ensure enough area for photosynthesis.\\n\\nPhilipp said producers should not keep cattle on summer-dormant fescue pastures to avoid overgrazing, soil compaction and creating openings for weed encroachment.\\n\\n“Have a plan in place to move animals somewhere else,” Philipp said, “preferably onto a warm season perennial pasture or pastures of summer annual forages.\\n\\nBermudagrass, because it is a warm-season perennial, will keep growing when it gets hot, Philipp said. But the wet, cool spring this year resulted in little growth going into the hot summer months. Conditions are compounded by a lot of weed pressure, he said.\\n\\nWhen field size is manageable, Philipp said, bushhog fields to cut down on weeds and fertilize the bermudagrass with about 50 to 60 pounds of nitrogen per acre.\\n\\n“Once rain resumes, bermudagrass will begin growing again and we’ll have about three months of growing season left,” Philipp said.\\n\\nIf drought conditions persist, Philipp said, handle bermudagrass with care:\\n\\nAvoid excessive vehicle or animal traffic on pastures;\\n\\nIf hay is needed, find a sacrifice pasture for feeding it to cattle to minimize the spread of weed seeds from the hay;\\n\\nWatch out for weed growth later in the season and following years after a drought and tackle weed control proactively to avoid longterm weed encroachment.\\n\\n“In the longterm, try to stay proactive by having options available,” Philipp said. Such options can include fields planted in summer annual forages.\\n\\nSorghum-sudangrass and pearl millet are relatively drought resistant, Philipp said. Although they don’t generate their maximum yield of growth during dry conditions, the amount of plant material available may be enough to provide cattle with forage during droughts.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Craig Roberts\\n\\nStunted, stemmy pastures unable to support grazing cattle have potential. Depend on fall rains to bring fall regrowth, says University of Missouri Extension forage agronomist Craig Roberts.\\n\\nCool-season grass growth always slumps in summer. Fescue goes dormant. This year, the slump dives deep with lack of rain and too much heat. In spite of that, Missouri farmers should prepare for fall regrowth for winter grazing.\\n\\nRoberts reminds farmers to think back to the big drought of 2012. After a prolonged dry spell, rains returned Sept. 1. After the drought, grass grew and soybean fields made big yields.\\n\\nFall rains and renewed growth are normal. Sometimes remnants of hurricanes, as in 2012, bring big rains.\\n\\nTo prepare for fall growth every year, farmers clip pastures to encourage regrowth and apply 40 to 50 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer. Then they wait for rains and new grass. Often as not, it works.\\n\\n“If you prepare and it rains, you win,” Roberts says. “If not prepared, you can’t win.”\\n\\nRoberts cautions farmers to not clip too early. “Wait to clip the canopy until mid-August.”\\n\\nFriendly weeds may prove welcome this year, Roberts says. Grassy weeds such as crabgrass, foxtail, barnyardgrass and goosegrass are summer annuals. “Weeds are just waiting to grow. If we get some rain, they may make forage to bale.”\\n\\n“Weeds aren’t great,” Robert adds. “But this year, take what Mother Nature gives. However, avoid baling poisonous or thorny weeds. We just want friendly weeds.”\\n\\nCool-season grasses have two growing seasons. The spring season provides two-thirds of annual production. That other third of growth usually goes into stockpile, which is left unbaled and held for winter grazing.\\n\\nWhen cows harvest grass by grazing, it cuts winter feed bills.\\n\\nManagement-intensive grazing, taught in MU grazing schools, boosts production per acre by one third.\\n\\nRoberts says he’s getting lots of phone calls about clipping pastures now. Farmers want to speed regrowth, but he urges patience. “Wait until the first or second week of August.”\\n\\nBy nature, Missouri farmers take risks. “Just wait and play the odds,” he says.\\n\\nRegional MU Extension field crops or livestock specialists advise on managing grass and cow herds.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Mark Landefeld\\n\\n“You gotta make hay while the sun shines”. How many times have you heard that said throughout the years? We’ve had some sunshine this spring/summer, but making first cutting “dry” hay has really been challenging for most farmers this year. Getting two or more days in a row without rain has been rare in the spring of 2018.\\n\\nMaking timely first cutting dry hay in Ohio always has challenges with weather it seems, but this year it definitely has been more than usual. Extremely good, high quality hay is made from young leafy forage at boot stage, not fully mature long brown stems with dried up seed heads like we have been seeing everywhere now in July. The combination of maximum yield and highly digestible dry matter is usually obtained at the late boot, to early head stage of maturity for grasses and in the mid-to-late bud stage of maturity for our legumes. Forages that can be harvested at that time, most often meet nutrient requirements of beef cattle, but accomplishing that this year has really been the exception, not the rule for most producers.\\n\\nBeef cows do not require the same level of nutrition dairy cows need to maximize production. However, this year is going to be challenging to have enough nutrients in most beef producers first cutting hay to maintain the cow’s minimum requirements without grain supplementation, mixing in high quality stockpiled forage, or adding good quality second cutting hay into the feeding scheme this winter. Forage testing should be done so producers know what their hay quality actually is and if adjustments need to be made.\\n\\nJust because there is hay in the bale rings for the cows to eat does not mean she can eat enough, or that there are enough nutrients in the hay, for her to function properly. Extended periods of poor nutrition can lead to calving problems, weak newborns, poor quality milk, rebreeding problems and many other costly complications. The multiple costs associate with feeding poor quality hay for an extended period of time are hard to put a dollar amount on, but they certainly are there!\\n\\nForage tests results may be extra valuable this year. With forage tests results we usually look at total digestible nutrients (TDN) and crude protein (CP) to determine the forage quality and use this information to calculate if there are enough nutrients to meet the livestock’s requirements in various stages of production. We may need to take a closer look at other information on the lab results this year as well.\\n\\nI expect neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content is going to be higher than normal in many producer’s hay bales because of the over mature condition of the hay. As forage plants mature, cell wall production in the plants increase and NDF content will increase, see Figure 1. As NDF content in a forage increases, dry matter intake decreases because it cannot pass through the cow’s system as fast. Therefore, with NDF percentages, we can accurately predict forage intake as it relates to bulk; or we could say, how much an animal will eat before its stomach gets full and stops eating. The higher the NDF value, the less the livestock can physically eat of that forage/day.\\n\\nMost mixed grass hay, after heading out, will have NDF values of 65% or greater. Beef cows can only consume about 1-1.2% of their body weight in NDF/day. So, a 1300 lb. beef cow could consume up to 15.6 lbs. of NDF/day on a dry matter (DM) basis. If our hay is 65% NDF a 1300 lb. cow can only eat 24 lbs. of this hay on a DM basis or approximately 27 lbs./day as fed. Without showing all the calculations in this article, this hay would cause more than a 2.2 lb. (±14%) deficiency in TDN/day for a superior milking, early lactating cow’s needs. This is why a cow can have a full stomach, but still lose weight.\\n\\nAsh levels in this year’s hay may be a concern too. As ash percentage increases, digestible dry matter decreases. I saw virtually no hay fields around my area this year without tracks left from equipment and areas of hay left unraked in the fields because the producer realized it was too wet to get through without excessively tearing up the field. Running equipment over hay, on ground that is wetter than usual, and around these wet spots for mowing, tedding and raking has undoubtedly caused dirt/mud to adhere, or splash in some cases, onto the forage that would not normally be there.\\n\\nDan Undersander, Forage Agronomist from the University of Wisconsin–Madison provides the following information and table. “Ash in forage comes from two sources: internal, e.g. minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus, and external, e.g. dirt, bedding, sand, etc. The average internal ash content of alfalfa is about 8% and of grasses is about 6%. Additional ash in a hay or silage sample is contamination with dirt, sand, etc. As shown in Table 1, a summary of ash content of forage samples submitted to the University of Wisconsin Soil and Forage Analysis Laboratory, the average ash content of haylage is 12.3% and of hay is 10.3%. Assuming the silage is mainly alfalfa and the hay has a higher percentage of grass, forage samples are averaging about 4% ash contamination from external sources. Note that some samples have been as high as 18%. This means this farmer had fed almost 1 pound of dirt with each 5 pounds of hay or haylage!”\\n\\nEmily Glunk, Montana State University, explains, “On average, ash can take the place of nutrients such as energy, protein and even some of the vitamins on a 1:1 basis. If you increase ash by 0.1 percent, you are potentially decreasing digestible nutrients by 0.1 percent.” Putting this into perspective from a dairy producer’s standpoint, Glunk said, “Alfalfa with an ash content of 8 percent and relative feed quality rating (RFQ) of 164 will produce 2,826 pounds of milk per ton, whereas alfalfa with 15 percent ash and a 147 RFQ will produce around 2,362 pounds of milk.”\\n\\nAsh content is only one item listed in a forage analysis, but I am interested to see what our analyses will show this year compared to others in the past. Studies have shown cutting height and type of rake used in the haymaking process are big factors that can increase ash content, above what is considered normal in forages. Some studies indicate that leaving a stubble height of about 3” provides the best results for reducing additional ash content while yet maximizing quantity of forage for harvest. The lower a producer cuts their forage to the soil surface; the more ash ends up in the forage. Studies have also shown ground driven wheel rakes generally add a few percentage points to ash when compared to other type rotary or power take off driven rakes.\\n\\nAnother point to consider this year is going to be heat damage to the forage. Many producers probably have hay that was baled wetter than optimum. In the June 13th issue of the Ohio Beef Cattle Newsletter Chris Penrose and Dan Lima provided information about dry matter percentages that are suggested for a variety of hay bale types when baling: Small squares to be 20% or less, Large round, 18% or less and Large squares, 16% when baling. Small bales dissipate heat faster than large round bales so small bales are less susceptible to longer periods of heating than large round bales. The goal for long-term storage and stability is a moisture content of <15%. The larger and denser a bale is, the less likely it is to lose moisture in storage and reach the stability desired, so the moisture at harvest becomes more critical.\\n\\nPenrose and Lima also provided information about what can happen when baling hay if it is too wet. Excessive microbial action causes hay to heat and if internal temperatures get above 150-160 degrees F, a call to the fire department may soon be needed because hay may ignite if exposed to air.\\n\\nAside from hay bales that catch on fire, the potential heat damage I’m referring to is what can be measured, using a laboratory forage test, if crude protein is lost due to heat damage. This amount shows up in the adjusted crude protein percentage in the analysis numbers. This reduced number reflects what happens to bales that were baled wetter that optimum, but not wet enough to cause the fire problem. Once temperatures reach 115-120°F a chemical reaction occurs between the protein and carbohydrates present in the forage. This reaction, called the Maillard reaction (often referred to as the browning reaction), is responsible for the characteristic, sweet smelling cured tobacco odor you may notice around your hay bales. While cows seem to like the taste of this type hay, the process denatures proteins making part of them unavailable for digestion by our livestock. Laboratory testing can show if an adjustment has been made for excessive heat damage. All rations should be balanced using the “Adjusted Crude Protein” rather than the other protein values listed on your forage analysis.\\n\\nOne more item producers may have to deal with this year is mold growth in hay bales. The presence of noticeable mold in stored forages indicates production problems, usually too much moisture. Once standing forage is cut, the moisture content of the plant starts to decrease. Bacteria and yeast populations, which were on the standing crop, are no longer as competitive as a new group of microbes that start to grow in the cut swath. These organisms feed off sugars and organic acids from the plant during the drying process. If hay is baled too wet, another group of microbes (mainly fungi and yeasts) starts to multiply, especially when the moisture content is between 20% and 30%. These new fungi outcompete the fungi that was on the forage in the swath or windrow because they can grow at a lower moisture level, but in higher temperatures that occur once the hay is baled. Each type of bacteria and fungi have their own ideal temperature and moisture level where they grow best, but none grow well at low moisture levels (<15%) and that’s why it is the stable moisture content goal we try to achieve.\\n\\nMold and hay quality is a very difficult issue because the presence of mold does not necessarily mean that the feed cannot be use. However, poor palatability and lower intake can be an issue that results in lower performance of the livestock that eat it. In addition, problems from mold occur because mycotoxins are produced by certain mold fungi and can be harmful to livestock. This is part of the decision-making problem, since not all molds produce mycotoxins, and the amount produced by those that do is unpredictable.\\n\\nMold spores can affect people too. Mold can cause a condition called farmer’s lung, where the fungus actually grows in lung tissue. So, always avoid breathing in spores if you have moldy hay. Horses are probably the livestock impacted most by moldy hay. It can lead to respiratory and digestive problems very easily, so do not feed moldy hay to horses.\\n\\nSo, what is the quality of the hay you made? As we have discussed, several factors effect quality and intake, but a forage test is the best starting point to know how to feed the hay you produced. Sampling multiple lots of hay would provide the best picture of your overall situation and provide information for you to make the best use of the forages. Different production dates, variation in the amount of grass vs. amount of legume composition in the fields or different rates of fertilizer you applied this spring could all be reasons for sampling multiple lots of hay.\\n\\nOne thing to remember, forage analysis results are only as good as the samples taken. Core samples should be taken with a forage sampler from 12-15 bales for each lot of hay being sampled. Place all of the core samples in a sealable plastic bag, taking care that fines material in the sample is not lost, which can skew the results.',\n",

Depending on weight, production stage, and environmental temperature, cattle require varying amounts of water. A University of Georgia publication suggests for cattle in 90 °F temperatures, a growing animal or a lactating cow needs two gallons of water per 100 pounds of body weight. A nonlactating cow or bull needs one gallon of water per 100 pounds of body weight. Using these figures, a single cow/calf pair can require roughly 25 to 40 gallons of water daily. A nursing calf with have a portion of its daily water needs from its dam’s milk. Providing multiple water sources or tanks in the pasture will increase consumption and decrease competition and fighting at the water tank.\\n\\nWater quality is just as important as water volume intake. Compromised quality can reduce water intake, which can lead to illness and metabolic issues. Testing water for salinity, nitrates, and sulfates is recommended. Cattle prefer water that contains small amounts of salt, however, water that contains high amounts of total dissolved salts (TDS) can result in reduced performance. Guidelines suggest that water containing 3,000 ppm TDS or less is usually acceptable for most livestock. In addition, water with salinity over 5,000 ppm TDS can act as a laxative and dehydrate cattle. Water more than 5,000 ppm TDS should not be fed to pregnant or lactating females.\\n\\nNitrates pose another issue for cattle. Nitrates are converted in the rumen into nitrites. While nitrates are not harmful to cattle, the conversion into nitrites can be toxic to cattle. Nitrites are absorbed into the bloodstream and convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Methemoglobin does not bind to oxygen, and the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is reduced. A safe level of nitrate nitrogen (NO3N) in the water for cattle is less than 100 ppm.\\n\\nSulfates can be found in feed and water. Testing water for sulfates can help you manage health risks to cattle by understanding how much they consume daily. The safe upper limit of sulfate consumption is 500 mg/L (ppm) (167 ppm sulfur as sulfate). Unsafe levels of sulfates may lead to polioencephelomalacia (PEM), a brain disorder in cattle, and cause digestive absorption issues. Distillers grains are also high in sulfur, so intake should be monitored in both water and feed sources.\\n\\nAdditional substances in water can cause decreased intake and potential health issues. High or low pH and excessive iron are common issues in Wisconsin. While these issues are not typically lethal, they can result in an “off flavor” which can reduce intake.\\n\\nDehydration and heat stress can set in quickly on hot summer days. Monitor the herd for open mouth breathing, sunken eyes, “Skin tent” after pinching skin, yellow or dark urine, and/or fever. Fever is indicated by a rectal temperature of more than 102.5 F.\\n\\nForage can impact how an animal deals with heat stress. Low quality forage has been shown to increase rumen temperature, therefore increasing internal temperature. Quality forage not only helps your cows metabolize at a healthier rate, it also can reduce the likelihood of higher internal body temperature. Providing shade when possible and fly control (either chemically or naturally with good ventilation/air flow) will reduce stress on animals as they seek a cool place to rest.\\n\\nGood management can help your herd beat the heat this summer.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Kris Ringwall\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the business of cattle, producers seek to move forward by anticipating future opportunities and realizing what obstacles are present.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is not easy. However, reviewing and understanding past numbers helps.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo where is the industry? My favorite process to evaluate cow-calf production numbers is to review CHAPS data collected through the North Dakota Beef Cattle Improvement Association and then turn to the North Dakota Farm Management education program (http://www.ndfarmmanagement.com) and FINBIN (https://finbin.umn.edu/) from the Center for Farm Financial Management, University of Minnesota, for the dollars. Interestingly, although they provide separate data sets, the data align quite well.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet us look at North Dakota FINBIN numbers from 2007 to 2017 to give us a snapshot of where the cow-calf industry is today. Ten years ago (2007), the gross margin for North Dakota cow-calf producers was $543 per cow. In 2017, the gross margin was $786 (up 145 percent), which means 45 percent more total dollars come into the cattle operation.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo what is gross margin? Gross margin accounts for the purchase and sale of all calves, cull cows and bulls, plus the animals transferred in and any overall changes in cattle inventory. Essentially, gross margin is the dollar number FINBIN uses to subtract direct and overhead expenses from to calculate net return per cow without labor and management charges deducted.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn general, the net returns for the beef enterprise dollars have been positive. Let us review some of those numbers. FINBIN gross margins experienced dramatics swings in the past 10 years: $543 in 2007, $464 in 2008, $451 in 2009, $578 in 2010, $729 in 2011 and 2012, $811 in 2013, $1,310 in 2014, $891 in 2015, $634 in 2016 and $768 in 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur memories should recall the significant increase in cattle prices a few years back as the last 10 years played out. While we hope that the factors that drove gross margins up would remain, the world does not work that way. The markets have highs and lows, and cattle producers must work within the forces that drive prices.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo simplify the numbers, let us compare 2007, 2008 and 2009 (the early years) with years 2015, 2016 and 2017 (the recent years). The average gross margin in the early three years was $486 ($543 + $464 + $451 divided by 3), and the average gross margin for the recent last three years was $764 ($891 + $634 + $768 divided by 3). This was an increase of $278 more per cow to spend.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is good. Or is it? Well, the answer is in the expenses. Total direct and indirect expenses for 2007, 2008 and 2009 were $445, $452 and $464, respectively (an average of $454). Net returns were $98 in 2007, $12 in 2008 and minus $13 in 2009. Total direct and indirect expenses for 2015, 2016 and 2017 were at $605, $574 and $618, respectively (an average of $599). Net returns were $286 in 2015, $60 in 2016 and $169 in 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, on the average, cattle producers spent 132 percent, or $145, more per cow at the end of the last 10 years than they did in the early years, 10 years ago. The bottom line: Even though expenses were going up, markets have provided a positive offset for the increase in expenses.\\n\\n\\n\\nCow calf producers’ net return increased from an average of $32 per cow in 2007, 2008 and 2009 to an average of $172 per cow for 2015, 2016 and 2017, which is good. Keep in mind that cow herd numbers need to be maintained to keep the cow enterprise going.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe average cost to purchase or transfer in replacement heifers per cow in the herd was $143 in 2007, $141 in 2008 and $172 in 2009, for an average of $152. The same costs were $371 in 2015, $261 in 2016 and $228 in 2017, for an average of $287. The cost of replacing cows went up 189 percent, or $135, per cow in the herd. Interesting.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the calves? Well, in 2007, the calves averaged 592 pounds and sold at $1.12 per pound. In 2008, the calves averaged 589 pounds and sold at $1 per pound, and in 2009, the calves averaged 605 pounds and sold at 95 cents per pound, a three-year average of 595 pounds selling at $1.02 per pound.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore recently, in 2015, the calves’ average was 554 pounds and they sold at $1.99 per pound. In 2016, the calves’ average was 588 pounds and they sold at $1.32 per pound, and in 2017, the calves’ average was 589 pounds and they sold at $1.62. The three-year average was 577 pounds of calf at an average price of $1.64 per pound.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe average cattle producer has decreased the weight of calves sold from 595 to 577 but increased the price received from $1.02 to $1.64. Good, maybe.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn closing, is the cow-calf enterprise keeping pace? Yes. The processes that drive calf prices have been good. Expenses have increased but at a lower percentage than gross margins. That is good, but calf weight remains stagnant, leaving opportunity on the table, a key to future success.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: ndsu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Stephen R. Koontz\\n\\n\\n\\nLast Friday’s (6/29/18) USDA NASS Acreage report showed 89.1 million acres of corn planted and 89.6 million acres of soybeans. The corn acreage is an increase from the 88.0 million acres of intentions from the March Prospective Plantings report. The record cold April transitioned into a record warm May for most of the upper Midwestern states. The slow start to planting finished on schedule and crop conditions are largely good to excellent. Harvest corn futures have decreased almost $1 per bushel and cow-quality hay is clearly abundant. The only places in the country without much pasture are south and west of southwestern Kansas. The weakening feed market has translated into strengthening calf prices relative to the fed cattle and beef market. The overall protein market outlook is much the same as the beginning of summer: there is a lot of protein to come to market through the summer and fall – and no end to the potential trade gymnastics – but calf market outlook is holding strong largely because of cheapening feed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe higher planted acreage and good feed crop conditions were largely revealed through June. The DEC18 corn contract decreased from the low-$4s to the mid-$3s the last half of the month. Therefore, the Acreage report was probably not much of a surprise. Further, it is the week of July 4th and the majority of the corn crop will be made at the end of this week – or for certain next. It seems unlikely there will be sufficient weather surprises for the rest of the summer to strengthen the feedstuffs markets. If anything there may be delayed maturity problems with the excellent moisture in the upper Midwest and eastern Corn Belt. This will be revealed much closer to harvest and I anticipate these to be minor and local. In the end this is good news for cow-calf producers. Risk management positions might be lightened while options still have considerable time-value.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, longer term caution is still warranted. Cattle on feed numbers, slaughter weights, and competing meat volumes all remain substantial. Beef trade volumes are strong but one wonders if this is filling the pipeline early to avoid problems later. For the short-term though, the market is revealing the abundant supplies of feedstuffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: osu.edu',\n",

However, operators of farm equipment must abide by different rules of the road than regular traffic.\\n\\nThe Highway Traffic Act requires slow-moving vehicle (SMV) signs on all vehicles that cannot reach speeds above 40 km/h. Vehicles that bear these signs are subject to a unique speed limit of 40 km/h while operating on a roadway.\\n\\nThe provincial government grouped tractors in this category.\\n\\nSo, operators must display SMV signs on their tractors and self-propelled farm machinery, even if their equipment is capable of travelling at a higher speed, Bob Nichols, senior media liaison officer with the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) told Farms.com today.\\n\\nPeople must place these signs on their equipment at a distance between 0.5 to 2 metres above the road, the Highway Traffic Act states. Other drivers must be able to see the symbol from at least 150 metres away.\\n\\nTractor drivers must also abide by this speed limit, even if they travel in zones with higher limits posted. Otherwise, these individuals could face penalties.\\n\\n“A fine between $60 and $1,000 may be imposed under the Highway Traffic Act if the tractor is travelling greater than 40 km/h,” Nichols said.\\n\\nFor more information on operating farm equipment on roadways, check out this guide from the MTO and this fact sheet from the OFA.\\n\\nCTV News photo',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTate Mesbergen of Mesbergen Farms feels the need for speed -- and so do his customers. After all, when the alfalfa is ready to cut, the farmers and local dairies north of Greeley, Colorado, don’t want any delays that could affect the value of their crop or quality of their feed. Fortunately, for those customers, Mesbergen Farms doesn’t disappoint.\\n\\nTate’s father, Harvey, began running JAGUAR forage harvesters made by CLAAS when he first started his custom cutting business more than 20 years ago. With the help of his sons Troy and Tate, and Tate’s wife Carly, the family operation is more productive than ever before. And while Harvey still prefers to run the CLAAS JAGUAR, his son Tate runs their triple mower conditioner, a DISCO 1100 RC, behind the wheel of their AXION 880 tractor. Both the mower and tractor are also made by CLAAS.\\n\\nOn July 1, 2018, just after noon, Tate put the hammer down on his triple mower in front of about 40 witnesses who came to cheer him on. Exactly eight hours later, he stepped out of the cab of his tractor as the new world record holder. A survey crew and independent witnesses would later confirm that Tate had cut a total of 348.7 acres (141.1 hectares) in four different fields, beating the previous record by more than 100 ac (40.5 ha).\\n\\nReaching a maximum speed of 19 mph (30 kph) in the field and more than 30 mph (50 kph) between fields, Tate averaged 43.6 ac/h (17.6 ha/h) in his world record attempt. “Not all of the fields were close together, so the ability to fold the mowers quickly for transport and make good time on the roads was key,” explained Tate.\\n\\nNot everything went as planned.\\n\\n“We had a thunderstorm come through the day before the attempt that dropped a half inch (12.7 mm) of rain and made the fields wetter than usual. It delayed our start by a few hours and made for a wet first field.” Tate also made two unscheduled stops during his attempt. The first stop was between the first and second fields. “I hit a chunk of cement in first field and wanted to confirm that I hadn’t damaged the mower. We did a quick inspection and both the blades and cutterbar looked fine.” The other stop was to check to make sure the DISCO mower was folded properly before getting on the road for the final field.\\n\\nThe prior record attempt was made in grass, not alfalfa, with a mower without a conditioner. A much easier task. According to Andreas Saile, CLAAS Product Manager for Balers and Hay Tools, “The DISCO 1100 RC has a full-width rubber roller conditioner that puts a crimp on the alfalfa crop for faster dry down and maximum leaf retention. The conditioner makes the mower a little heavier and it requires more horsepower, but it didn’t slow Tate down.” During his attempt, Tate cut an impressive 2.34 dry tons/ac (5.24 t/ha) of alfalfa.\\n\\nCLAAS is in the process of submitting paperwork to Guinness to make the record official in the eyes of the world record governing body. It usually takes several weeks to get an official confirmation.\\n\\n“A couple years ago, our dealer, Taylor Implement, brought the tractor and triple mower out to demo,” explained Tate. “We were blown away by the performance of both machines and added them to our operation.”\\n\\nLast November, the Mesbergens joined a trip hosted by CLAAS to visit the company’s manufacturing facilities in Germany and France. As part of that trip, the tour group made a stop in Hannover, Germany, to visit Agritechnica, the world’s largest farm show.\\n\\n“We were walking around the farm show and saw a banner claiming that a Polish manufacturer held the world record for the most hectares harvested with a triple mower in an 8 hour period,” explained Tate. “I was with my dealer at the time and told him I thought I could break the record.”“At a reception that night, I had the opportunity to meet Cathrina Claas-Mühlhäuser, the Chairwoman of the CLAAS Supervisory Board. When I mentioned the record, she told me to go for it! So we did.”\\n\\nSource : CLAAS',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s 2018 Custom Rates Survey indicate rising costs for machine hire operations and related services since the survey was last conducted two years ago. The survey of custom operators summarizes the current rates charged for specific machinery operations commonly used by agricultural producers.\\n\\nSurvey participants reported a state average labor rate of $18.85, which is 6% higher than in 2016. With diesel costs on the rise in 2018, $2.46 per gallon was the average farm delivered diesel price for the state, up from the 2016 rate of $1.68 per gallon.\\n\\nSimilar to two years ago, 2018 survey participants reported noticeable increases with some custom machine hire rates, while there were only minor changes in some rates. For example, planting row crops with row cleaners went from $18.91 per acre in 2016 to $21.12 per acre in 2018, while drilling soybeans with a no-till drill went up just slightly from $17.76 per acre to $18.02 per acre. Harvest rates for fall crops generally stayed in the same range as the prior survey; however, combining irrigated corn using a flat rate per acre is at a state average of $38.22 in 2018, which is $1.00 to $3.00 per acre higher than previously reported.\\n\\n“It is important for custom operators to take into account machinery, fuel and labor costs as rates are determined. Necessary expenses vary across the state as local demand and availability of labor may affect costs,” noted Glennis McClure, farm and ranch management analyst and extension educator. “While the Custom Rates Survey report may serve as a guide, farmers and ranchers are reminded to use their own judgment and consider their costs when negotiating custom operation rates.”\\n\\nFindings from the survey are divided into two major sections. Part one includes spring and summer operations such as tillage, planting and harvesting of small grains. Part two includes information about fall and miscellaneous operations. Custom rate summaries in these sections include regional rates for the eight Nebraska Agricultural Statistics Districts and the overall state.\\n\\nA total of 151 custom rates on machinery operations and related services were reported as part of the 2018 survey with 227 survey participants providing information on the various rates. Custom rates reported include charges for the use of necessary equipment, fuel, labor and supplies, such as baling wire or twine, provided by the custom operator. Seed, fertilizer and chemical costs are not included.',\n",

It\\'s not always that first trial is the right. Sometimes we have to do things and change things to make it better and we\\'re open to that because we\\'re a small business, so we can easily reach in and make some changes.\"\\n\\nMandako now employs between 50 and 60 people.\\n\\nAll products are manufactured in Plum Coulee, which include the Mandako Landroller in addition to the Stubble Cruncher and a number of tillage machines. Redekop notes they\\'re considering adding a number of new products in the years to come, with the goal of being recognized worldwide.\\n\\nHe notes his family has become more involved in the business over the past few years.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very little involved these days, due to health and retirement, and so I thank the Lord for giving us a family that is very diverse...they basically have been running the business with little supervision from myself.\"\\n\\nRedekop mentioned how farmers have evolved over the years, and how that has impacted the products that they build. He also talked about the importance of going to trade shows and the wealth of information that can be gained from attending.\\n\\nGeneral Manager Waldemar Berg, who is John\\'s son-in-law, explained the philosophy behind their products.\\n\\n\"Build good equipment,\" he said. \"Equipment that I would buy myself and serve the customer because if we serve the farmer, we will feed the world.\"\\n\\nBerg gave his thoughts on the work John has done building the business over the past three decades.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s phenomenal when I look at where John started and what he\\'s done. I think it\\'s a great effort, it\\'s amazing.\"\\n\\nOne thing that Berg would like to see going forward, is the use of more automation in their operations. He also talked about the importance of listening to employees when they have ideas, in order to make their products better.\\n\\nSource : Steinbachonline',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you’re working to harvest corn, you may know how important it is to have a folding corn head that can move between fields with ease. A John Deere folding corn head may be just the equipment you’re looking for as you work with this crop throughout the season. There are a number of models specially designed to meet a wide range of needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n600FC Series Corn Heads\\n\\nThe 608FC and 612FC folding corn heads can work with your John Deere S-Series combine seamlessly. The 608FC is specifically designed for transport on narrow roads, one-lane bridges, or any time transport width may be an issue. If you select the 612FC, you’ll raise your acres harvested by 30 acres per day, compared to a traditional eight-row corn head. In addition, you’ll also reduce your operating costs by up to 15 percent, making this an ideal machine if you’re interested in boosting your overall efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe headers can be folded without needing to leave the cab. In turn, this means that operators can easily move from field to field quickly and easily. Both models are also equipped with the StalkMaster™ chopping system. This allows operators to chop corn stalks while harvesting, eliminating the need for second-pass operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n700FC Series Corn Heads\\n\\nThe 708FC and 712FC folding corn heads are two newer models that corn producers may also want to consider working with out in the field. Similar to the 600FC models, these machines have the StalkMaster corn head chopping system that allows for the chopping of corn stalks while harvesting. They also have hydraulically-adjustable deck plates, which reduce ear loss to maximize potential yield and minimize material-other-than-grain intake.\\n\\n\\n\\nAutoTrac RowSense™ is a feature of both the 708FC and 712FC. RowSense allows operators to maintain harvesting efficiency in down crop and low visibility conditions. In turn, it increases acre-per-hour performance potential and reduces grain loss.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTate Mesbergen of Mesbergen Farms feels the need for speed — and so do his customers. After all, when the alfalfa is ready to cut, the farmers and local dairies north of Greeley, Colorado, don’t want any delays that could affect the value of their crop or quality of their feed. Fortunately, for those customers, Mesbergen Farms doesn’t disappoint.\\n\\n\\n\\nTate’s father, Harvey, began running JAGUAR forage harvesters made by CLAAS when he first started his custom cutting business more than 20 years ago. With the help of his sons Troy and Tate, and Tate’s wife, Carly, the family operation is more productive than ever before. And while Harvey still prefers to run the CLAAS JAGUAR, his son Tate runs their triple mower conditioner, a DISCO 1100 RC, behind the wheel of their AXION 880 tractor. Both the mower and tractor are made by CLAAS.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn July 1, 2018, just after noon, Tate put the hammer down on his triple mower in front of about 40 witnesses who came to cheer him on. Exactly eight hours later, he stepped out of the cab of his tractor as the new world record holder. A survey crew and independent witnesses would later confirm that Tate had cut a total of 348.7 acres (141.1 hectares) in four different fields, beating the previous record by more than 100 acres (40.5 hectares).\\n\\n\\n\\nReaching a maximum speed of 19 mph (30 kph) in the field and more than 30 mph (50kph) between fields, Tate averaged 43.6 ac/h (17.6 ha/a) in his world record attempt. “Not all of the fields were close together, so the ability to fold the mowers quickly for transport and make good time on the roads was key,” explained Tate.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot everything went as planned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We had a thunderstorm come through the day before the attempt that dropped a half inch (12.7 mm) of rain and made the fields wetter than usual. It delayed our start by a few hours and made for a wet first field.” Tate also made two unscheduled stops during his attempt. The first stop was between the first and second fields. “I hit a chunk of cement in first field and wanted to confirm that I hadn’t damaged the mower. We did a quick inspection and both the blades and cutterbar looked fine.” The other stop was to check to make sure the DISCO mower was folded properly before getting on the road for the final field.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe prior record attempt was made in grass, not alfalfa, with an unconditioned mower. A much easier task. According to Andreas Saile, CLAAS Product Manager for Balers and Hay Tools, “The DISCO 1100 RC has a full-width rubber roller conditioner that puts a crimp on the alfalfa crop for faster dry down and maximum leaf retention. The conditioner makes the mower a little heavier and it requires more horsepower, but it didn’t slow Tate down.” During his attempt, Tate produced an impressive 2.34 dry tons/ac (5.24 t/ha) of alfalfa.\\n\\n\\n\\nCLAAS is in the process of submitting paperwork to Guinness to make the record official in the eyes of the world-record-governing body. It usually takes several weeks to get an official confirmation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A couple years ago, our dealer, Taylor Implement, brought the tractor and triple mower out to demo,” explained Tate. “We were blown away by the performance of both machines and added them to our operation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nLast November, the Mesbergens joined a trip hosted by CLAAS to visit the company’s manufacturing facilities in Germany and France. As part of that trip, the tour group made a stop in Hannover, Germany, to visit Agritechnica, the world’s largest farm show.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We were walking around the farm show and saw a banner claiming that a Polish manufacturer held the world record for the most hectares harvested with a triple mower in an 8-hour period,” explained Tate. “I was with my dealer at the time and told him I thought I could break the record.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“At a reception that night, I had the opportunity to meet Cathrina Claas-Mühlhäuser, the Chairwoman of the CLAAS Supervisory Board. When I mentioned the record, she told me to go for it! So we did.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTo view photos of the historic event, click here.\\n\\nSource: CLAAS',\n",

This means taking the necessary steps to monitor the machine throughout all stages, from setup to operation. Before loader tractor ballasting, the operator should review the manual in order to maximize safety, stability, and performance while putting their John Deere equipment to work.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at how to optimize loader tractor ballasting while maintaining safety throughout the operation.\\n\\nBefore operating your machine, it is recommended that you review the operator’s manual to understand requirements for specific tasks. For loader tractor ballasting, refer to the “Preparing the Tractor” section of your operator’s manual for information on tread settings and balanced recommendations.\\n\\nIn order to prevent rollover and subsequent injuries, adjust tractor rear tread settings to the widest possible settings.\\n\\nDifferent tractor models call for different front tread settings when managing stability on uneven terrain. Please review your manual for specific requirements.\\n\\nTread adjustment can be accomplished in various ways depending on axle type. This includes adjusting rear wheels outward when operating a tractor equipped with rack and pinion rear axles, swapping wheels to opposite sides, or simply reversing the wheel disk.\\n\\nCounterbalance weight is required for loader tractors for stability and maximum loader capacity. This can be added in up to three areas – rear wheel weights, ballast box on three-point hitch, and fluid-filled rear tires.\\n\\nCounterweight ballasting should begin with removing all front weight, including the weight bracket, if applicable.\\n\\nIn your operator’s manual, refer to the specification section to find information distinct to your model. This will provide locations and minimum amounts of counterbalance weight.\\n\\nOnce setup is complete, it’s important to note that loads should be carried low to the ground when transporting in order to continue maximizing stability.\\n\\nSource : Machinefinder',\n",

Growth in our undergraduate poultry science students is directly linked to the Foundation’s support. This year’s funding, for example, has allowed us to reach out to more than 3,400 K-12 students and potential college transfer students to promote the range of career options in the poultry and allied sectors. To do so, we utilize14 of our top students as program ambassadors. To accelerate awareness, our faculty has also been developing teaching models for high school STEM and vocational agriculture teachers that we demonstrate during our summer academy workshop, allowing the participants to gain comfort and competence in incorporating poultry examples into their curricula.”\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Alayna DeMartini\\n\\nResponding to the increased demand for lamb meat, more Ohio farmers are raising flocks of sheep.\\n\\nThe high slopes of southeast Ohio and other parts of the state are suited more for grazing animals than for row crops.\\n\\n“You can put cattle and sheep across those areas and make it productive land,” said Roger High, executive director of the Ohio Sheep Improvement Association (OSIA).\\n\\nMany have. Across the state, the number of sheep flocks has grown in the past decade in response to an increasing demand for lamb meat. Much of the growth has been among Amish farmers in several counties, some of them former dairy producers who took up raising sheep for a chance at higher profits, High said.\\n\\nSome cattle producers have recently started grazing sheep on the same pasture as their cattle. And in cities and suburbs in northeast Ohio, some are using lambs to trim their grass instead of pulling out the lawn mower, said Christine Gelley, Ohio State University Extension educator in Noble County. OSU Extension is the outreach arm of The Ohio State University’s College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences.\\n\\nInterest in sheep production dwindled in the 1980s and 1990s when lamb prices were low and parasites plagued flocks. But the renewed interest among people wanting to eat lamb has triggered more demand for the meat in the United States. But much of that demand is filled by imported lamb from Australia, Gelley said.\\n\\n“We are not meeting the domestic demand,” Gelley said of the U.S. sheep industry. “So there’s a lot of room to grow.”\\n\\nAnyone interested in raising sheep or who is already doing so is invited to flock to the upcoming Ohio Sheep Day in Caldwell on July 14. Participants can learn about how to raise healthy sheep, including avoiding parasites, creating an efficient sheep handling system and improving fencing to bar coyotes.\\n\\n“They love lambs – unfortunately,” High said of coyotes.\\n\\nParasites too have been problematic for flock owners. They dwell in the grass, and when eaten by sheep or lambs, suck the animal’s blood, and can weaken and eventually kill the animal. Having sheep move around to different sections of pasture helps avoid contact with the parasites, High said.\\n\\n“The most interesting part of Sheep Day is people coming together and sharing about their flocks and the issues they face and kind of helping each other out,” High said. “Hopefully, they’re going to walk away with something that will make their sheep operation more profitable and productive.”\\n\\nOhio Sheep Day will be at the Eastern Agricultural Research Station, 16870 Bond Ridge Road in Caldwell. The cost is $15 for OSIA members and $25 for nonmembers. The cost includes lunch. OSIA memberships can be purchased during registration.\\n\\nSince State Route 821, also known as Marietta Road, will be closed due to construction, motorists should take I-77 to Exit 25 for Caldwell and State Route 78. From the exit ramp, turn onto State Route 78 headed east. At the second traffic light, turn left onto State Route 821 North. Follow 821 North through Caldwell, toward Belle Valley. Just before the road closure, turn right onto State Route 215 East. The farm is located about 1 mile ahead on the right. The driveway is Bond Ridge Road.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nick Simmons\\n\\nRecent reports of salmonella sickness by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has caused an increased focus on animal-human interaction. According to these reports, over 100 people in multiple states have been ill with salmonella. The CDC states that the most likely cause is their interaction with live poultry in backyard flocks. More recently, there have been at least 18 outbreaks of Virulent Newcastle Disease in Southern California. This disease is a highly contagious and often fatal virus that affects the respiratory, nervous, and digestive system of birds and poultry. It is important to note that no human cases of Newcastle have been reported from the consumption of poultry products (proper handling and cooking is always important.)\\n\\nThese reports are a good reminder that proper biosecurity by both small poultry flock owners and visitors should be exercised. It should come as no surprise that there are associated risks with livestock production, even in the smallest backyard flocks. Poultry are in constant contact with the outside world and their desire to scratch and peck the ground exposes them to numerous biological pathogens. Standard biosecurity practices within a home flock should become normal practice for poultry owners and can be easily implemented. Some steps you can take to best secure your flock include:\\n\\nWashing, rinsing and disinfecting feeders and waterers every week to 10 days. More often if heavily used\\n\\nQuarantine any birds that appear to have even slight to moderate symptoms of abnormalities\\n\\nImplement a pest control program, this should include rodents, insects, and snakes.\\n\\nSecure your poultry from natural predators, this may include a family pet like a dog or cat\\n\\nLimit the number of people who encounter your poultry, especially family or friends who own flocks\\n\\nEnsure you are acquiring birds from reputable sources. Most commercial hatcheries have stringent biosecurity measures at their facilities.\\n\\nQuarantine any new birds for at least 14-21 days before introducing them to your flock .\\n\\nWash your hands before and after handling birds. A disinfectant by the coop can be handy as well.\\n\\nEnjoying your backyard flock should be one of the delights of raising poultry on your own. They provide hours of entertainment and usually a few eggs each day! Ensuring that you and your animals are safe should be a top priority. As always, reach out to professionals, hatcheries, Extension agents, or other seasoned poultry owners for information.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Brady Campbell\\n\\nWhile this grazing project was conducted with small ruminants, it also relates easily to pasture management of beef cattle.\\n\\nAnother school year has passed and I am happy to say that I have completed my third year of being involved in AS 4004, Small Ruminant Production at The Ohio State University. This year Dr. Liz Parker and myself co-instructed this course and worked diligently to expose our students to every aspect of the small ruminant industry, including extension outreach and producer education. As a part of the course curriculum, students were challenged to compose an Ag-note (educational poster) to highlight a specific topic that is related to sheep or goat production, management, and husbandry. As viewers, you will see these unique postings appear periodically and will be noted in the title as “Ag-note.”\\n\\nFor our first Ag-note (linked below), OSU students DeVaughn Davis, Nathaniel Kinney, Kristy Payne, and Dalton Shipley share an economic perspective on the comparison of continuous versus management intensive grazing.\\n\\nGrazing systems will vary greatly depending upon several factors including time, labor, and fencing supplies. Thankfully, shepherds have a few options when it comes to different grazes strategies. The simplest grazing system would be continuous grazing. Continuous grazing is where animals are placed in a pasture with a perimeter fence and one water source. Animals are not rotated and continually graze the same land without any type of internal divisions. Continuous grazing is beneficial from the standpoint that it requires low financial inputs, capital costs, and minimal labor. However, this grazing system becomes costly and an issue as some forage species do not have enough time to regrow due to animals grazing them as soon as new growth begins. As a result, pastures will show a reduction in yield per acre, become susceptible to overgrazing, and show an increase in undesirable forages and weeds.\\n\\nOn the other hand, graziers may use a series of rotations where animals are given a specific amount of time on a specific pasture/paddock and then moved to the next area. For those graziers that are interested in capitalizing on land yield and utilization, one may consider using management intensive grazing. Management intensive grazing describes the intensity of management being placed on your rotation criteria. Rotations in this type of grazing system are based upon forage height, stocking density, forage quality, and parasite status. The benefits of management intensive grazing include increased pasture yields, quality of feed, and improved pasture parasite management. However, this grazing system does not come with out a cost. Management intensive grazing requires an increase in labor and management as well as initial costs for extra fencing and watering supplies needed for each individual paddock.\\n\\nMIG management during this project resulted in twice as much forage being grazed!\\n\\nFor more detail on how this project and an economic analysis comparing these two grazing systems, please refer to the Ag-note in this link: Comparison of Continuous vs. Management Intensive Grazing\\n\\nEfficient utilization of pasture land is key an all grazing systems. Management intensive grazing may be one solution that can be implemented on-farm in order to maximize pasture utilization. Although rotational grazing requires more time and labor inputs, the forage production generated from this management practice will pay for itself as it will yield a greater amount of forage per acre as well as decrease the need for supplemental feeding, thus decreasing feed costs.\\n\\nTo conclude this topic, the Economics group wanted to leave readers with 4 keys that will help lead to grazing success.\\n\\nKeys to Success:\\n\\n1. Begin grazing pasture when forages are 6-10 inches in height (will vary dependent upon forage species).\\n\\n2. Do not graze pastures below 3 inches in height.\\n\\n3. Let paddocks rest and recover for 10-60 days (dependent upon environmental conditions).\\n\\n4. Learn to adapt to environmental conditions and challenges.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Margaret Ross and Patricia Burch\\n\\nThe poultry industry is growing again in North Carolina and poultry producers are needing waste plans completed. For producers in need of a waste plan, here is the information I will need to complete the cover sheet of your plan: name of farm, land owner’s name, mailing address, county, phone number, type of poultry, integrator name, and the one-time placement number of birds.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are using a 3rd party applicator to remove your litter, there is a form both the farm owner and the 3rd party applicator will need to agree upon, sign and date. If you are applying the waste yourself, please bring the maps provided by the county Farm Service Agency office of where you plan to apply the litter. These maps need to show field location, crop acreage, and be labeled to identify crops and spreading rates for each field. Nitrogen requirements will also be needed from the North Carolina Nutrient Management Program, where RYE (Realistic Yield Expectation) data is found online. I will determine the dominant soil type of each field and be able to complete the plan with this information.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoil samples are currently required every three years from all fields that receive litter and must be processed by an approved lab, but you are welcome to test more often than this. You can have your samples processed in Raleigh at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture Agronomic Division laboratory. These records must be kept for three years, or if you are participating in a funding program with NRCS (National Resources Conservation Service) you must keep your records for five years. There are fees associated with soil testing during peak seasons for the laboratory, so be sure to check the rates before sending your samples.\\n\\n\\n\\nWaste analyses are required within 60 days before or after a litter application (120-day window) and must also be kept three years or five years if participating in funding from NRCS. The maximum spread rate and nitrogen balance can be determined by using the PAN (Plant Available Nitrogen) numbers. Both the soil test results and the waste analysis results are now only available online unless you request a hard copy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last part of the plan are the spreading records forms (Dry 1, 2, and 3). These forms can be found at your local Cooperative Extension office, or you can request an electronic copy. There is also an Excel computer spreadsheet version that will do calculations automatically to ensure no errors. You will need the following information to complete these forms: date and amount of litter removed, date and location of spreading, date, fields and amount spread, as well as the nitrogen balance. Make sure you keep these forms updated on a regular basis and that everyone who applies the litter is filling out the correct forms.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does your waste plan do for you and your farm? It gives you the necessary information to properly apply litter at agronomic rates on your fields. This way you are sure you are not over-applying nutrients and the plants are able to completely use the litter as fertilizer. Making sure your waste plan is complete and accurate is the first step in making sure you are properly spreading litter from your poultry operation.\\n\\nSource: ncsu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': 'LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The 2018 forecast for total meat production is lowered from last month, but production forecasts are unchanged for 2019. Beef production for 2018 is lowered primarily as lighter carcass weights more than offset higher second-quarter steer and heifer and cow slaughter. Pork production for 2018 is lowered on the current pace of secondquarter slaughter and lower-expected commercial slaughter in the third quarter. Slightly heavier expected hog carcass weights in the second and third quarters partially offset declines in slaughter. USDA’s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released June 28th and will provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of 2018. Broiler production for 2018 is raised on the pace of second-quarter production data and stronger growth in production during the second half of the year. Turkey production in the second quarter of 2018 is raised on the current pace of slaughter; no changes are made to outlying quarters. Egg production for 2018 is raised on recent hatchery data.\\n\\nThe 2018 beef import forecast is raised on increased shipments from Oceania, while the beef export forecast is raised largely on strong Asian demand reflected in recent trade data. The 2018 pork export forecast is raised on continued strong shipments to a number of key markets and expectations of continued pork exports to Mexico. Pork exports for 2019 are raised on expected strong demand to a number of key trading partners. Second-half 2018 turkey export forecasts are raised as U.S. prices remain attractive. The 2018 broiler trade forecast is unchanged from the previous month. No changes are made to 2019 beef and poultry trade forecasts.\\n\\nCattle prices for 2018 are lowered slightly on second-quarter price data; no changes are made to outlying quarters. Hog prices are raised for the second quarter of 2018 on current price strength, but no changes are made to the outlying quarters. Second-quarter broiler prices are lowered for 2018; no changes are made to outlying quarters. Turkey prices are increased fractionally for 2018, reflecting a higher second-quarter forecast. Egg prices for 2018 are lowered on recent price data. For 2019, hog prices are lowered on weaker expected demand, but no changes are made to cattle, poultry, and egg price forecasts for 2019. The milk production forecast for 2018 is reduced from last month on slightly lower cow numbers and slower expected growth in milk per cow. No change is made to the annual cow herd for 2019, but the milk production forecast for 2019 is lowered from last month on continued slow growth in milk per cow.\\n\\nFor 2018, fat basis exports are raised from the previous month as second-quarter exports are strong and continued strength in sales of a number of fat-containing products will largely mitigate the impacts of Mexico’s tariffs on U.S. cheese. For 2019, the fat basis export forecast is lowered. Skim-solids basis export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised from the previous month on robust demand for non-fat dry milk and lactose thus far in 2018, and this strength is expected to carry into 2019. Fat basis imports for 2018 and 2019 are raised on higher imports of butterfat products, while skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced\\n\\non lower imports of milk proteins and a number of other dairy products.\\n\\nThe 2018 cheese price is unchanged at the midpoint of the range, but is raised for 2019. The 2018 butter price forecast is raised, but is reduced slightly for 2019. Nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey price forecasts are raised for both 2018 and 2019 on strong demand and a reduced production forecast. For 2018, the Class III price is raised on the stronger whey price. The Class IV price forecasts reflects higher butter and NDM prices. For 2019, both Class III and Class IV prices are raised. The all milk price is forecast higher at $16.60 to $17.00 per cwt for 2018 and is increased to $16.70 to $17.70 per cwt for 2019.',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Carl Zulauf\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics\\n\\nOhio State University\\n\\nJonathan Coppess, Nick Paulson,and Gary Schnitkey\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics\\n\\nUniversity of Illinois\\n\\nWith the implementation of tariffs taking effect, President Donald Trump’s trade policy has roiled commodity markets. Tariffs have been imposed on U.S. imports, triggering counter-tariffs on U.S. exports with ag commodities a common target (see farmdoc daily April 17, 2018 for example). Existing trade agreements, notably NAFTA, have also been reopened. These events bring to mind the partial embargo of U.S. ag exports to the Soviet Union imposed on January 4, 1980 by President Jimmy Carter in response to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. It was lifted by President Ronald Reagan on April 24, 1981. This article examines U.S. exports of corn, soybeans, and wheat in long term perspective with a focus on the USSR grain embargo period. Its focus is U.S. exports to the world, not just to the USSR. Quantity of U.S. corn, soybean, and wheat exports were little impacted during the years of the USSR grain embargo, but declined in the years that followed. Moreover, U.S. corn and wheat exports have never really exceeded the quantity they reached in the early 1980s.\\n\\nBackground and Data\\n\\nThe USSR grain embargo of 1980 was a partial, not total embargo on a wide range of agricultural products, including grains, oilseeds, as well as meat and livestock products. Sales to the USSR remained large as previous trade commitments were honored. It is also important to note that it was the 4th U.S. embargo or moratorium on exports since 1973. The first was a ban on all exports of soybeans, cottonseed, and their products during the summer of 1973 in response to very high soybean prices and concern about domestic U.S. supplies. The second and third were U.S. moratoria on export sales to the USSR in 1974 and to the USSR and Poland in 1975 as a response to the U.S. drought of 1974 and USSR drought of 1975. While the USSR embargo of 1980 has garnered the most attention over time, it is more likely that 4 embargos / moratoria in a span of 7 years had a cumulative effect that exceeded their individual effect. For an extensive and excellent discussion of these embargos and moratoria, with a focus on the 1980 embargo, see the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service (ERS) report published in November 1986.\\n\\nThe data used in this study are U.S. and world exports of corn, soybeans, and wheat measured in million metric tons (MMTs). Source is “PSD online” (USDA, Foreign Agriculture Service). The analysis starts with the 1964/65 (1964) crop year, the first year data are reported for soybeans.\\n\\nU.S. Exports in Long Term Historical Perspective\\n\\nQuantity of U.S. exports of corn, soybeans and wheat rose by 373%, 67%, and 104%, respectively, from 1970 to 1980 (see Figure 1). Corn exports have never really exceeded the 61 MMTs exported during the 1979 crop year, although exports were slightly larger in 2007 at 62 MMTs. Wheat exports peaked at 48 MMTs in 1981, a level never approached since. Next highest year was 1987 at 43 MMTs. Soybean exports did not consistently exceed their late 1970/early 1980 level until the late 1990s. Peak exports are 59 MMTs in 2016.\\n\\nIn contrast to the U.S., exports of wheat by the rest-of-the-world (ROW) increased consistently after 1980 (see Figure 2). ROW soybean exports remained stable from 1980 through 1985, then began to increase consistently. The rate of increase accelerated after 1995 with China’s emergence as a major importer. ROW corn exports were erratic around their 1980 level until 1990, then began to increase. Interestingly, ROW corn and soybean export quantity have tracked one another since the mid-1990s.\\n\\nU.S. share of world corn and wheat exports rose during the 1970s (see Figure 3). U.S. soybean share began to decline after 1976 as South America emerged as an exporter. Since 1980, U.S. soybean and wheat share has declined fairly consistently at annual rates of -1.3 and -0.7 percentage points, respectively. Corn’s share declined erratically at a rate of -0.3 percentage point per year between 1980 and 2000. Decline has since accelerated to -2.2 percentage points per year, with decline particularly large from 2007 to 2011.\\n\\nUSSR Grain Embargo\\n\\nU.S. corn, soybean, and wheat exports were, respectively, 20%, 11%, and 25% higher in 1979-80 than in 1977-78 (see Figure 4). Wheat exports were the same in 1983-84 as 1979-80, but 1983-84 U.S. corn and soybean exports were less than in 1979-80 and even 1977-78. Corn and wheat exports in the pairs of years after 1984 were lower than in 1979-80. Soybean exports were higher, but only markedly so in 2016-17. The pairs of years, in chronological order, precede the embargo; cover the embargo years, immediately precede the 1985 farm bill’s substantial reduction in U.S. prices to stimulate demand, and then at roughly 10 year intervals.\\n\\nAs with quantity of U.S. soybean and wheat exports, U.S. share of world exports for these crops was higher in 1979-80 than 1977-78 (see Figure 5). U.S. corn export share was slightly lower in 1979-80, possibly due to the U.S. drought of 1980. By 1983-84, U.S. share was lower than even in 1977-78 for all 3 crops. Other than for corn in 1995-96, U.S. share is lower for all pairs of years since.\\n\\nThe USDA, ERS report of November 1986 concluded that, while international trade was rearranged, the embargos and moratoria had limited impact on the quantity of U.S. exports in the short run. While acknowledging the difficulty in assessing long-term impacts, it attributed most of the decline in U.S. exports that followed the 1980 USSR grain embargo to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar and a slowing of world economic growth. In addition, already high loan rates were raised for corn and wheat in the wake of the 1980 USSR grain embargo. As a result, U.S. policy provided an umbrella for the rest of the world to expand production. This umbrella remained in place until the 1985 farm bill substantially reduced loan rates. Clearly, all these factors would negatively impact U.S. exports. However, given (1) U.S. exports of corn and wheat have never exceeded early 1980 levels despite long term world economic growth, large fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, and the dramatic U.S. farm policy changes in 1985; (2) U.S. share of world exports for all 3 crops has continued to decline; and (3) nearly 40 instead of 5 years have passed; it is reasonable to ask whether the long term impact of the embargos and moratoria of the 1970s/1980s was more than this study suggests?\\n\\nSummary Observations',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs explained in previous articles from this season (Dicamba Injury Mostly Confined to Specialty Crops, Ornamentals and Trees so Far, Dicamba Injured Crops and Plants Becoming more Evident: June 15th Update ), I have attempted to provide updates as to the extent of dicamba injury throughout the United States, either in the form of official dicamba-related cases that are currently under investigation by the state Departments of Agriculture, or as estimates of dicamba-injured soybean acreage from university weed scientists. Herein, I provide the maps below as an update of the situation as of July 15th.\\n\\nBecause there seems to be great confusion and/or controversy over the maps, I just want to explain once again what these maps contain. First, university weed scientists estimate to what extent they are seeing dicamba injury in their respective states. It is an estimate. My colleagues use extension agents and other trusted sources throughout their state to generate these estimates just like I do in my own state. Hopefully everyone on all sides of this issue can appreciate that much more happens than what actually gets turned into the state Departments of Agriculture; that is the reason for the map of estimates.\\n\\nThe second map contains the number of actual dicamba-related injury investigations that are being conducted by the various state Departments of Agriculture. These are ongoing investigations and are not final. Given the significant strain that has been placed on these agencies who are now dealing with 2 to 3 times the number of investigations as in the past (usually without any added personnel or funding), I doubt these cases will be able to be finalized any time soon.\\n\\nAs for the information within the maps, as a point of reference, last season the first time we published any U.S.-wide information was on July 25th ( Ag Industry, Do we have a problem yet? ). At that time, there were 1,411 dicamba-related injury investigations being conducted by the various state Departments of Agriculture while university weed scientists estimated approximately 2.5 million acres of soybean had been injured with dicamba. To date, at about the same time in 2018, we have somewhere around 600 cases being investigated by the state departments of agriculture and approximately 1.1 million acres of soybean estimated with dicamba injury by university weed scientists. This information, of course, is only as good as the source and it should be noted that these totals do not reflect what has happened in those states who were unwilling to participate and provide information for this survey. I would also be remiss if I did not mention that these numbers are reflective of what has happened after tighter label restrictions, cut-off dates in certain states, and mandatory training which were not in place in 2017.\\n\\nAs I’ve said from the beginning on this whole issue, there are great differences in perspective about the extent of this problem and what constitutes success with this technology. Unfortunately, one’s perspective on this issue within agriculture seems to be closely linked to the company you work for or the type of seed you buy; a fact which I must confess disappoints me greatly and in my opinion is incredibly short-sighted.\\n\\nIn the first draft of this article, I started to go on and “wax eloquent” here about all of those issues again but upon re-reading, I deleted all of it. The truth is, as I was looking back to that first 2017 report (Ag Industry, Do we have a problem yet?), I stumbled onto the last two paragraphs of that article which contained two questions that, for the most part, I had pretty much forgotten about. One year later, I realized the most productive way I could end this article is to leave you with these same (modified) questions:\\n\\nFirst, does 605 official dicamba-related injury investigations and/or approximately 1.1 million acres of dicamba-injured soybean constitute a problem for U.S. agriculture?\\n\\nSecond, can you look at the scale and the magnitude of the problem on these maps and really believe that all of this can collectively be explained by some combination of physical drift, sprayer error, failure to follow guidelines, temperature inversions, generic dicamba usage, contaminated herbicides, and improper sprayer clean out, but that volatility is not also a factor?',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of late there have been some changes to the crop acreage reports. Oklahoma State University Extension Grain Market Economist Dr. Kim Anderson joins host Dave Deeken this weekend on SUNUP to explain what is causing these adjustments and the reshuffling of acres planted and what impact that is having on commodity prices here in Oklahoma. According to Anderson, the big picture here is the price relationships between our major crops like wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum, etc.\\n\\nAnderson explains that when looking back over the better part of the last decade, wheat for instance has not been near as profitable as other crops that have slowly gained in popularity. However, profits have leaked away, and farmers are now gravitating toward other options in search of more sustainable profits. That fact is reflected in the numbers as reported by the USDA.\\n\\nThis is evident enough in consideration of just one year ago when producers planted 350,000 acres of corn in Oklahoma. This year, that number is down to 310,000. Sorghum acres have seen a sharp uptick this year at 400,000 compared to last year’s 315,000. Soybean acres rose by a relatively modest 5,000 from 655,000 to 660,000 this year. Cotton planted acres skyrocketed dramatically up from 585,000 to 720,000 and wheat acres dipped slightly again this year by 100,000 acres from 4.5 to 4.4 million acres. To put that into perspective, wheat’s average planted acres in Oklahoma has been roughly 5.1 million acres, but again have fallen due to pressures from lack of profitability.\\n\\nGiven production in Oklahoma, the impact that these adjustments have had on the price of wheat, Anderson says is largely insignificant. However, when considering the broader impact that price relationship has had on other commodities, we can see a ripple effect.\\n\\nAnderson says the price of corn has been on a steady decline for several months now, having fallen near a dollar to about $3.20 currently. Sorghum is nearby that at $3.25 depending on the location. Soybeans have become subject to heightened volatility and speculative talk, partially due to a record year for soybean production but also trade tensions and tariffs from China. USDA in its latest World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimates report brought the price of soybeans down from right at $10 to $9.25. Cotton, however, seems to be the crop offering the most profitability, currently at $0.884 on the December contract with a projected price for next year by the USDA at $0.75. But, to earn that price, Anderson warns farmers must first get good production out of their crop.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Rodrigo Werle\\n\\nAt the beginning of July, the weather finally became conducive for POST-emergence herbicide applications in southern Wisconsin, including for dicamba application in Xtend (dicamba-tolerant) soybeans. Typically, injury from micro-rates of dicamba (via tank-contamination, particle and/or vapor drift) in susceptible crops tends to show at 10-14 days after the incident (see: Soybean Injury From Dicamba A4161 ). Driving around the southern part of Wisconsin this past week, I have noticed a couple instances of dicamba injury in soybeans (I estimate less than 15 total injured acres).\\n\\nFigure 1. Non-Xtend soybeans injured by dicamba in south-central Wisconsin.\\n\\nLast year, Dr. Kevin Bradley, Professor and State Extension Weed Scientist with the University of Missouri, kept track of the estimates of dicamba-injured soybean acreage across the United States (see: A Final Report on Dicamba-Injured Soybean Acres ). This year, EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and others have requested Dr. Bradley to continue the effort.\\n\\nDr. Bradley is in communication with the State Departments of Agriculture regarding official complaints but is also attempting to track dicamba-injured acres that are not being officially reported. Thus, if you have noticed dicamba injury in your soybeans and/or other susceptible crops in Wisconsin, regardless on whether an official complaint was/will be filed with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCAP), it would appreciated if you could send me an email (rwerle@wisc.edu) describing the county, crop and number of dicamba-injured acres or plants (if referring to vegetable or ornamental crops). Pictures of the dicamba-injured crop would also be of extreme value.\\n\\nThe information sent to me will be kept confidential and only used to update Dr. Bradley’s estimates and hopefully provide valuable information to decision-makers this fall to support their decision on whether to extend EPA registrations for Engenia, FeXapan and Xtendimax herbicides in Xtend soybeans.',\n",

       "     'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Loren Giesler\\n\\nFigure 1. Frogeye leaf spot will initially show up as only a few lesions in the canopy.\\n\\nOver the past few days we've received several reports of frogeye leaf spot in soybean. Frogeye leaf spot, a fungal disease caused by Cercospora sojina, is becoming more common across the eastern third of Nebraska.\\n\\nWith most of the soybean crop entering early pod stages over the next week, now is the time to decide whether you need a fungicide. Yield loss estimates due to frogeye leaf spot have been reported as high as 30% nationally with extensive leaf blighting; but for Nebraska I would estimate less than 20% yield loss in highly susceptible varieties.\\n\\nThe disease is most severe when soybean is grown continuously in the same field, particularly in fields where tillage is reduced, since this is a residue-borne disease. The primary source for this disease is infested residue, infected seed, and airborne spores. In areas where this disease has been observed in past years it will typically show up again if weather conditions are favorable. Overcast conditions or high humidity are favorable and irrigation or recent rains in some portions of the state will increase the potential for this disease.\\n\\nWhat to Look For\\n\\nInfection can occur at any stage of soybean development, but most often occurs after flowering and is typically in the upper canopy. Initial symptoms are small, dark spots on the leaves. Spots eventually enlarge to a diameter of about ¼ inch. The centers of the lesions will become gray to brown and have a reddish purple margin. Individual leaf spots can coalesce to create irregular patterns of blighting on the leaf.\\n\\nManagement of Frogeye Leaf Spot\\n\\nResistance. Soybean varieties vary in their resistance to frogeye leaf spot. Several genes are commonly used to provide resistance. You will want to know the susceptibility of your variety if you’re trying to decide whether a fungicide is warranted.\\n\\nCultural Practices. Frogeye leaf spot is more severe in continuously cropped soybean fields. Reduced tillage systems will tend to have more as the pathogen overwinters in residue.\\n\\nFungicide Application. A fungicide application to manage frogeye leaf spot is typically not warranted in most Nebraska fields. Fields with a history of frogeye should be watched carefully and if disease develops, application of a strobilurin fungicide at the R3 (pod set) to early R4 growth stage is considered most effective. Most current fungicide products are combinations with different modes of action that have activity against this fungus and are a good resistance management strategy.\\n\\nDisclosure\",\n",

Today, Dr. Selk addresses the time of day when harvest occurs and how it can impact the concentration of harmful nitrates in forages.\\n\\n\"Forage sorghums are used by cattle producers for summer grazing or harvested for hay. Forage sorghums can be very productive and high quality, but can also accumulate toxic levels of nitrate when stressed. Based on the assumption that the plant continues soil nitrate uptake during nighttime hours, followed by accelerated conversion of the nitrate to protein during daylight hours, previous extension recommendations have been to wait until afternoon to cut forage sorghum for hay if anticipated nitrate levels are marginally high.\\n\\n\"To evaluate the significance of the change in nitrate concentration in forage sorghums during the day, Oklahoma State University Extension Educators collected samples at two hour intervals from 8 AM to 6 PM. Five cooperator’s fields (\\'farm\\') were divided into quadrants. Three random samples, consisting of ten stems each, were taken from each quadrant at the specified interval. The samples were analyzed at the Oklahoma State University Soil, Water, and Forage Analytical Laboratory to determine the level of nitrates, in parts per million (ppm).\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Adam Russell\\n\\nA convergence of weather and market conditions have put a number of Texas beef producers in a tough spot, facing rising supplemental feed prices and lower sale prices at local auctions, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service experts.\\n\\nDr. Jason Banta, AgriLife Extension beef cattle specialist, Overton, said extended winter weather led to less carryover of hay supplies compared to last year. Cool spring temperatures slowed summer grass emergence before drought conditions set in. Lower temperatures also reduced typical hay harvests by half in many production areas, including East Texas.\\n\\nSecond hay cuttings have been below-normal in quantity and quality due to drought as well, he said. Drought conditions are also affecting hay availability in other nearby states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas, as herd sizes continue to expand.\\n\\n“That means hay supplies will be tight,” he said.\\n\\nDr. David Anderson, AgriLife Extension economist, College Station, said the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports hay stocks each year on Dec. 1 because it is a relatively good starting point for supplies of hay for winter feeding. Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas hay stocks were down 27, 16, 21, and 8 percent, respectively on Dec. 1.\\n\\nAfter a winter of feeding, May 1 hay stocks were down 63 percent in Texas and Louisiana, 52 percent in Oklahoma, and down 40 percent in Arkansas compared to the year before, according to the USDA.\\n\\nNormally, nationwide, this is the time of year that hay prices tend to decline as production picks up around the country and before hay purchases get started in order to stock up for winter, Anderson said.\\n\\nPrices for large round bales in North, Central and East Texas have risen amid low supplies and high demand, Anderson said. Round bales that sold for $50-$65 in early July last year are now selling for $70-$90.\\n\\n“While we have had some rains around the state over the last couple of weeks, a large area of the state has been and remains in some measure of drought condition,” Anderson said. “Continued drought and dry conditions could leave us in a bind for hay supplies heading into the fall.”\\n\\nRising hay prices and lower cattle price trends should be a concern for producers, he said.\\n\\n“You’ve got to think carefully about how much you want to spend on feed when cattle prices are in decline,” he said.\\n\\nDespite the rise in hay prices, feed costs are down dramatically over the last several weeks, Anderson said.\\n\\nIn the case of corn and soybeans, the U.S. crop is off to a great start, and early indications are for some record corn yields in parts of the corn belt, Anderson said. Southern Plains corn prices dropped to about $3.50 per bushel last week, down from over $4 per bushel about six weeks ago. Central Illinois soybean prices fell from about $10 per bushel to about $8 per bushel over the same time period.\\n\\nWhile the soybean crop appears to be a big one also, the prospect of tariffs hitting exports have contributed to lower prices, Anderson said.\\n\\nFalling feed prices have provided a little boost to calf and feeder prices at local auctions, he said. Rain can also boost calf prices as well.\\n\\n“A little rain usually leads to a little rise in calf prices,” Anderson said. “Producers who received rain won’t sell and can afford to bid more for a calf when they have forage potential and feed costs less.”\\n\\nAgriLife Extension district reporters compiled the following summaries:\\n\\nCENTRAL: Irrigated cotton acres progressed well, but dryland fields were very poor. Second cuttings of hay did not come this year, and ranchers started feeding hay and supplements already. Livestock were in good condition. Crops were being harvested, but production was low. Grain sorghum harvest was almost complete with decent yields of 2,500-4,000 pounds per acre. Corn harvest started and yields were decent in the early stages. Counties reported fair soil moisture. Overall crop, rangeland and pasture conditions were fair in most counties.\\n\\nROLLING PLAINS: Hot and dry conditions were the norm. Some spotty storms popped up throughout the reporting period and provided very quick, heavy rainfall but only in a few locations. Lightning strikes during the storms caused multiple fires. Pasture conditions were very poor in some areas, and supplemental hay was being fed. However, in other areas, livestock were in good condition with little to no supplemental feeding taking place. Most forage sorghum that was planted was either baled or grazed. Cotton conditions vary from poor to good, depending on planting date and ground moisture during planting. Irrigated cotton looked good. Fields were prepared for wheat planting. Grasshoppers continued to be a problem.\\n\\nCOASTAL BEND: Recent rains improved overall conditions for many growers. Some areas suffered drought conditions followed by excessive rain that negatively impacted the harvest of corn and grain. Grain moisture was higher than desired, and lodging continued to be a problem. Both sorghum and corn were harvested where dry enough to get into fields. Cotton defoliation began and several fields were ready to be harvested. Cotton growers continued to monitor bollworms and were working hard to keep their damage to a minimum as populations increased. Rice was nearly all headed out. Mosquitoes continued to be a problem in most areas affected by recent rains. Pastures and hay fields responded well to increased soil moisture. Hay harvest was in full swing, and most pastures were in good to excellent condition. Livestock were doing well.\\n\\nEAST: Several days of scattered thunderstorms and light rain improved prospects of a decent hay crop and improved grazing conditions in many parts of the district. Harrison, Houston and Smith counties all received beneficial rains in areas, while other parts of the counties were still in dire need of moisture. All counties continued to report serious deficits of rainfall, which caused great concern among producers and homeowners. Many of Harrison County producers started putting out hay while some Houston County producers still had not cut hay. Smith County producers were calling for hay purchase information. Pasture and rangeland conditions in Angelina and Harrison counties were poor, while Rusk and Sabine reported good conditions, and Shelby, Smith and Wood counties reported fair conditions. Subsoil conditions were very short in Shelby County and short in Angelina, Harrison, Houston and Smith counties. Sabine and Wood counties reported adequate subsoil conditions. Topsoil conditions in Angelina, Houston, Rusk, Shelby and Smith counties were short. Adequate topsoil conditions were reported by Harrison, Sabine and Wood counties. Shelby County reported calf prices were down per hundredweight. Livestock were in fair to good body condition. Grasshopper and feral hog control was underway in Wood County, and Shelby County reported armyworms.\\n\\nSOUTH PLAINS: Subsoil and topsoil moisture levels improved with recent rain, however, due to low moisture levels, soil moisture continued to be low. Acres of irrigated corn and cotton planted early and that received rain looked good. Corn was progressing and cotton setting bolls. Dryland cotton that emerged, and even some irrigated fields, still needed a lot of help from rain. Producers were going to have to manage uneven stands. Pest issues in cotton and corn remained light. The sugarcane aphid arrived on sorghum fields but in isolated colonies and low numbers. Growth stages in grain sorghum were all over the board. Many acres were just planted. Peanuts continued to do well. Pasture, rangeland and winter wheat continued to need rain. Cattle were in good condition.\\n\\nPANHANDLE: Hot and windy conditions were reported. Temperatures were normal. Soil moisture was short and irrigation was very active. Some moisture was received. Amounts were scattered and ranged from a trace to 1.5 inches in some areas. More moisture was needed throughout the district. Quite a bit of corn was silking or will be soon. Hot dry winds caused some corn to stress. Dry conditions were affecting all crops, especially dryland fields. Sunflower planting finished. Rangeland was very dry. Cattle were in good condition. Some cow-calf herds grazed Conservation Reserve Program grasses as the USDA authorized emergency grazing due to drought. Warm temperatures and moisture helped crops. Cotton was coming along well with the heat units, and some cotton had open blooms. Corn was coming along with many fields starting to tassel, and later-planted silage fields were at about 24 inches. Wheat harvest was over with some dryland fields doing surprisingly well considering the conditions.\\n\\nNORTH: Topsoil and subsoil moisture levels ranged from mostly adequate to short across the counties, with some reporting very short. Most counties received 0.2 to 2 inches of much-needed rain. Daytime temperatures were in the mid-90s, with heat indexes above 100. The wheat harvest was complete, and yields were average this year. Corn was starting to mature, and soybeans and cotton looked good, but more rain was needed. Ponds were shrinking, and some producers were feeding supplemental feed. Hay producers reported the first cut of hay was much lighter than last year, and rain was needed if the second cuttings were to be better. Hay was hard to find in Cass County. There were reports of grasshoppers.\\n\\nFAR WEST: Temperature highs were in the upper 90s with lows in the high 60s. Scattered showers brought 0.39 to 2 inches in areas that received rain. Pastures were still very poor and most cotton never emerged due to lack of moisture. Irrigated cotton was starting to improve due to scattered showers. A lot of fertilizer was being applied. A few hot spots of spider mites and stink bugs were reported. First picking of watermelons was winding down. Corn was drying down, and sorghum made good progress. Fruit on trees were maturing. Pecan trees needed supplemental watering. Trees showed average nut sets on certain varieties. Insect control was necessary in livestock handling facilities and on livestock because of moisture. Winkler and Regan counties were experiencing above average greenness in rangeland and pastures. Shipping of lambs and kids was complete.\\n\\nWEST CENTRAL: Most of the district received some rainfall with amounts ranging from 1.3-2 inches. However, some areas did not receive any moisture. Temperatures were forecast into the 100s, so the moisture was not expected to last long. Round bales were being moved to livestock. Prices on stocker steers and heifers were steady. Feeder steers were $3 higher than last reporting period. Feeder heifers were $1 to $2 higher. Packer bulls were steady and packer cows were $2 to $3 lower. Pairs and bred cows were steady with limited sales. Pecan producers with irrigation were watering. Harvest of winter wheat was complete, and some producers planted hay grazer for summer grazing and hay production.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Adam J. Varenhorst\\n\\nWe are receiving a lot of reports of small white, red, or orange maggots present under the epidermis of soybean plants. These maggots are associated with enlarged, woody soybean stems near the soil surface. The infested plants break very easily near the affected area. The maggots causing this issue are larvae of the gall midge (a kind of fly), and this isn’t the first time they have been observed in South Dakota. Although our initial observations were that gall midge larvae are simply feeding on secondary fungal pathogens, our neighbors in Iowa and Nebraska have reported the larvae feeding directly on soybean plants.\\n\\nThis transition in feeding behavior hasn’t been observed in South Dakota to date, but we are currently watching for it. When scouting soybean fields, monitor the base of stems for swelling and discoloration (Figure 1). If soybean plants easily snap while walking through them, this could be an indicator of a gall midge larvae infestation. Researchers at Iowa State University and the University of Nebraska have noted that the infestations they are observing tend to start near the edges of fields. If potentially infested plants are identified, peel back the epidermis to determine if the gall midge larvae are present. The larvae are small maggots and will vary in color from white (Figure 2) to orange or red (Figure 3).\\n\\nFigure 1. Soybean plant with woody, enlarged area near the soil surface.\\n\\nFigure 2.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Todd Hubbs\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics\\n\\nUniversity of Illinois\\n\\nThe escalating trade issues between the U.S. and many of our trading partners continue to affect the outlook in both corn and soybean markets. Drastic price declines since Memorial Day show the impact of trade uncertainty and yield potential. The prospect of large yields combined with trade issues set the baseline for determining export potential and price formation in both corn and soybean markets moving forward.\\n\\nThe USDA soybean export projection for the current marketing year totals 2.085 billion bushels, up 20 million bushels from last month’s estimate. Census Bureau export estimates through May place soybean exports at 1.762 billion bushels. Census Bureau export totals came in 42 million bushels larger than cumulative marketing year export inspections over the same period. As of July 12, cumulative export inspections for the current marketing year totaled 1.873 billion bushels. If the same difference in export pace continued through the current period, soybean exports would total 1.915 billion bushels as of July 12. For the remainder of the current marketing year, 24.2 million bushels of soybean exports are required each week to meet the USDA projection. During the last four weeks, export inspections of soybeans averaged 24.5 million bushels per week. Low soybean prices encouraged sales to destinations other than China over the last few weeks. As of July 5, total outstanding sales for the current marketing year totaled 263 million bushels, which is well above the estimated 170 million bushels required to meet the USDA projection. While China looks to cancel the 26 million bushels of outstanding sales it possesses, total outstanding sales still sit above the estimated total to meet USDA projection for this marketing year.\\n\\nAdjustments to 2018-19 marketing year trade numbers in the latest USDA forecasts present a bearish picture for soybean exports. A reduction of 250 million bushels, to 2.04 billion bushels, from last month’s soybean export forecast is not a surprise given the current trade environment. In conjunction with lower U.S. soybean export projections, the USDA reduced the Chinese soybean import forecast to 3.491 billion bushels. The 73 million bushel reduction from last marketing year is the first decrease in year over year imports by China since the 2003-04 marketing year. While Chinese imports appear set to decrease, the USDA projects substantial increases in South American production next marketing year. Argentine recovery from last season’s drought and expanded acreage in Brazil place soybean production forecasts in the region at 7.1 billion bushels, up 808 million bushels from the current marketing year. Barring a resolution to current trade issues, soybean exports next marketing year will struggle despite the low prices currently in place.\\n\\nThe prospect of record corn yields and the uncertainty surrounding trade continue to place pressure on corn prices. At 2.4 billion bushels, the USDA estimate for corn exports during the current marketing year appears somewhat optimistic given cumulative exports to date and unshipped sales. Export estimates by the Census Bureau through May place corn exports for the marketing year at 1.656 billion bushels. Through July 12, cumulative export inspections totaled 1.907 billion bushels. Using the relationship between export inspections and Census Bureau totals, exports for corn currently sit at 2.01 billion bushels. For the remainder of the marketing year, export inspections need to average approximately 56 million bushels per week to meet the USDA projection. For the last four weeks of export inspection data, corn exports averaged 56.7 million bushels per week. Total outstanding sales for the current marketing year sit at 454 million bushels, which is above the 394 million bushels required to reach the USDA projection. While corn exports may fall short of the current estimate, the blistering export pace in the second half of this marketing year looks set to continue into the fall.\\n\\nCurrent USDA projections for corn exports during the 2018-19 marketing year total 2.225 billion bushels, up 125 million bushels from last month’s projections. World import projections during the upcoming marketing year provided by the USDA sit at 5.95 billion bushels, up 193 million bushels over the current marketing year estimates. A low price and poor corn crops in South America and the Black Sea region provide an outlook for continued strength in corn exports as we move into the next marketing year. Current export sales data give indications to support this idea. As of July 5, corn outstanding sales for the 2018-19 marketing year sit at 183 million bushels, a 41 percent increase in sales from the same time last year.\\n\\nExports in both corn and soybeans built some strength over the last few weeks as lower prices spurred demand. Current estimates of export pace place both crops on track to meet or come near USDA projections for this marketing year. The size of the 2018 crop domestically and in key producing regions will provide a critical factor in determining U.S. export potential next marketing year. A resolution of trade issues with China and NAFTA partners would provide needed support. Current developments appear to make this a low probability event in the near term.',\n",

This symptom will first appear on younger leaves.\\n\\nDifferent factors cause these problems.\\n\\nPotassium deficiency tends to appear in areas where crops have not established strong root systems. Sidewall compaction and a lack of rainfall can contribute to this situation, the report said.\\n\\nPlants may also struggle to absorb potash in dry conditions, even if soils contain sufficient levels of this nutrient.\\n\\nIf farmers do not address these deficiencies, their fields could suffer.\\n\\n“Soybeans take up and remobilize a considerable amount of potassium to produce the crop,” Kowalski said. “Whenever you short one of those macronutrients, you are looking at substantial yield loss.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, producers may be unable to reverse the damage, as many fields are too far into the growing season.\\n\\n“It’s difficult to alleviate (potassium) deficiency now, since foliar products cannot supply enough (potash) through the leaf tissue to rectify the problem,” the report said.\\n\\nHowever, in late-planted fields that severely lack this nutrient, farmers may still be able to apply dry potash, the report stated.\\n\\nSoybeans could fall victim to manganese deficiency, in contrast, if the fields have unfavourable pH levels.\\n\\n“As soil pH increases, less manganese is available to the plant,” the report said.\\n\\nThis nutrient deficiency tends to become an issue on poorly drained soils, such as clays and silt loams, and fields with high levels of organic matter, the report said.\\n\\nTo prevent this deficiency from damaging their crops, growers can apply a foliar manganese. By taking this step, farmers could see their yields improve by up to eight bushels per acre, the report said.\\n\\nGrowers can take soil samples to identify which nutrients their crops need. When submitting these tests, farmers may want to ask the lab to look for soybean cyst nematode, as this pest can cause plants to show symptoms similar to the signs of potassium deficiency.\\n\\nFor more information on weeds, pests and crop diseases, check out the Farms.com Field Guide .\\n\\nUPDATED JULY 17, 2018\\n\\ngilaxia/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

While aphid populations are low in most fields, we have received reports of increasing soybean aphid numbers. In parts of central Minnesota, some of these fields are nearing threshold levels and will likely require insecticide treatment soon to protect yield. Early-planted soybean in areas with moderate rainfall this year might see significant aphid populations first. However, aphids are now spreading to other fields putting them at risk too. Below, we provide an overview of scouting recommendations and updates on insecticide resistant soybean aphids.\\n\\nScouting and threshold:\\n\\nHow will you know if any of your soybean fields are at economic risk from soybean aphid? The decision to apply insecticide for soybean aphid should be based on scouting and the economic threshold. Briefly, you need to get into the field to count or estimate aphid numbers on plants. Count the number of aphids on plants selected from throughout the field. Compare the average number of aphids from those plants to the economic threshold. The economic threshold for soybean aphid is an average of 250 aphids per plant with more than 80 percent of the plants infested with aphids, and the aphid population appearing to be increasing. See our soybean aphid scouting guide , if you need a refresher on scouting tips and techniques for this pest.\\n\\nRemember, the economic threshold is the trigger point for scheduling an insecticide application to prevent populations from reaching an economically damaging level, which is called the economic injury level. A more detailed discussion of these concepts can be found in our Review of the Biology and Economics of Soybean Aphid Management Recommendations.\\n\\nAlternatively, treatment decisions for soybean aphid can be made using Speed Scouting, which is a scouting and decision-making procedure that doesn’t require counting large numbers of aphids. Speed scouting can provide a more efficient option for some users to make treatment decisions. Validation research has shown this methods to be somewhat conservative (slightly over-recommending treatment).\\n\\nApply full labeled rates of insecticides for soybean aphid management and follow the instructions on product labels.\\n\\nInsecticide resistance:',\n",

The sclerotia are the hardened reproductive bodies of white mould and they can remain infective for over three years.\\n\\n“White mould is a big problem and is pretty consistent across Eastern Canada,” said Bohner, the soybean specialist for OMAFRA, in an interview with Farms.com. “It is very difficult to prevent” the disease from becoming established in fields, as “sclerotia move with the equipment and dirty seeds.”\\n\\nHorst Bohner, Soybean Specialist for OMAFRA, discussing white mould at Bayer's 2018 Dead Weeds Tour.\\n\\nThe first step to dealing with white mould is understanding the different soybean varieties available. Some varieties can be very susceptible to the disease, while others have a high tolerance, Bohner said.\\n\\nIn addition to variety selection, crop rotation can have a significant impact on the sclerotia counts in the top soil. Fields with a history of white mould should not be in two or three-year rotations with broadleaf crops, he noted.\\n\\nTillage can also affect the spread of the disease. Farmers using both no till strategies and deep tillage have had varying success in reducing the appearance of white mould. Deep tillage can reduce the amount of sclerotia found in the topsoil but further tillage can bring it up again. No-till practices leave the sclerotia in the upper soil profile, which allows it to rot and cycle out of the field.\\n\\nFoliar fungicides are another important part of the toolkit.\\n\\n“When I started this job, there were essentially no foliar fungicides in soybeans,” Bohner said. “Today, that’s changed. We do have products that offer pretty reasonable suppression. It’s not full control but it will help if it’s part of a strategy.”\\n\\nFinally, producers are gaining access to newer tools and practices, such as variable rate seeding, to help fight this disease.\\n\\n“It’s a very innovative approach, so I can see some potential,” said Bohner.\\n\\nProducers can selectively limit populations in trouble areas. Indeed, farmers could cut seeding rates in these sections in half, he said. The result is a more controlled canopy density.\",\n",

Note the yellowing between the veins in the leaves.\\n\\nMany soybean fields in eastern South Dakota are showing symptoms of Iron Deficiency Chlorosis (IDC) again in 2018. As soybean plants begin to develop true leaves, interveinal yellowing can be observed (Figure 1). This yellowing, or chlorosis, is caused by a shortage of iron (Fe) in the plant, resulting in reduced chlorophyll production. The first trifoliate leaves will remain green because there is enough Fe stored in the plant to support early leaf and plant growth. Iron is immobile in the plant. Therefore, symptoms are exhibited in the newest plant tissue.\\n\\nIf Fe deficiency persists, leaf tissue and even the plant growing point may die. In addition to being important for chlorophyll production, Fe is important for energy transfer within the plant cells, enzyme production, and root nodule formation. Soybeans can recover from IDC if 1) it is not too severe and 2) environmental conditions improve, allowing root systems to uptake more Fe. Unfortunately, even in mild cases of IDC, any yellowing will most likely cause yield losses.\\n\\nMost soils have a contain an abundant supply of Fe. The problem is, most of this Fe is in a form that plants cannot use. Plant available Fe is reduced by: high soil pH, high soil carbonate concentrations (CaCO3 or MgCO3), poor soil aeration (waterlogged conditions), and high concentrations of soil nitrate (NO3-). Any of these factors alone or in combination with one another can interact to decrease soil available Fe. Soybean roots release inorganic acids and enzymes to increase Fe availability in the soil. IDC is generally not a problem in soils with pH values less than 7.\\n\\nSo, what can producers do to prevent and/or manage for IDC?\\n\\nPlant varieties with a good IDC score. No varieties are completely tolerant but there are large differences. Some varieties are simply better at excreting root acids to increase soil available Fe. This is the most important management consideration when dealing with IDC.\\n\\nIncrease plant populations in problem areas. Some research has shown that increasing planting population can reduce the severity of IDC simply by increasing the amount of soybean plant roots producing exudates. For example, if a producer normally seeds at 140,000 seeds/acre, they may want to increase to 200,000 seeds per acre in problem areas.\\n\\nRotate away from soybeans for a time. Some producers have mentioned that 4-5 years of continuous corn production will greatly reduce their IDC problem when they shift back to soybean production. The reasoning is not entirely understood but it could have something to do with the acidity of the nitrogen fertilizers used in corn production reducing soil pH over time.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Bruce MacKellar\\n\\nCorn and soybean plants have been showing signs of drought stress from hot and dry conditions.\\n\\nWeather\\n\\nThe old adage that if you don’t like what you see in the weather, wait five minutes and it is likely to change has not been much the case in the southwest Michigan region this year. We have seen longer duration condition changes that have tended to stick around this season. Our current trend has been hot and dry. While sub-soil moisture levels and surface water resources remain near all-time high levels, precipitation has been very limited over the last two weeks. Corn and soybean plants have been showing signs of drought stress from these conditions. It is not unusual to see irrigation systems to be running in fields that still have standing water in a portion of the field.\\n\\nArmyworm defoliating corn near Lawrence, Michigan.\\n\\nImpacts from weather\\n\\nThe extreme wet conditions have led to wild variations in crop maturity in southwest Michigan. There are large numbers of acres in the heavier soil areas in Van Buren County that were unable to be planted until very late June or early July. Most of these will be prevented planting acres, although an amazing number of acres of soybeans were planted during this period. The fallout from this is that we have corn fields that range from V4 to tasseling, soybeans that range from just short of R3 to V1, and harvested wheat all in the same neighborhoods.\\n\\nSo far, the higher than normal temperatures have been favorable for the rapid development of later planted corn and soybeans. We will likely need to keep these on track, as well as maintain favorable precipitation levels, for the later planted crops to reach high yield potentials.\\n\\nCorn\\n\\nAdvanced fields are in full pollination. Latest planted are around V4, the average around V8-V9. Growers have overall done a very good job at trying to manage nitrogen on corn in very challenging conditions this spring. The depth of corn color on most fields has been excellent. Dry conditions going into the most critical period for corn moisture stress, pollination and early grain fill, are worrisome for the earliest planted dryland corn.\\n\\nWestern bean cutworm moth flight is underway across the region. It is unclear what impact the flooded soil conditions had on larval survival. Moth catch numbers have been very low to this point in my traps. However, trap counts near Sturgis (23) and Union City (48) showed activity is ramping up. I have not seen egg masses in the few fields I have walked.\\n\\nRemember, pre-tassel corn is the most likely fields female moths will find attractive for egglaying should western bean cutworm numbers increase in the next couple of weeks. Treatment threshold is reached when 5 percent of the plants have egg masses (cumulatively over the two-to-three-week egglaying period).\\n\\nAsiatic garden beetles have emerged and are moving from corn fields to soybeans. Adult movement occurs primarily at night and the beetles will be often burrow underground near favored food sources during the day. Adult Asiatic garden beetles can be found in soybean fields, particularly under marestail and giant ragweed plants that escaped control this spring.\\n\\nWe do believe this pest was impacted by flooded soil conditions, as larvae were observed on the soil surface following heavy rainfall in May. Michigan State University Extension entomologist Chris DiFonzo has been conducting research on Asiatic garden beetles with support from the Michigan Corn Growers Association in several areas across southern Michigan. She will share some of her findings in meetings this winter.\\n\\nArmyworm has been active in pockets this spring, and we have seen a much longer duration of moth flight this year than normal. A field in central Van Buren County was severely impacted by this pest over the last week. Late instar armyworm can defoliate fields quickly. While sporadic armyworm has been observed in many fields this spring, this outbreak level event appears to be isolated. These larvae were large, and should pupate soon, bringing the damage from these pests to a close. See armyworm control options.\\n\\nSoybeans\\n\\nSoybean crop stage of development is all over the board.\\n\\nWeed escapes are prevalent across the region this year. Marestail remains the most prevalent, although many producers have begun using Liberty Link and or Extendimax technology to provide post emergence options for season long control. We have seen several fields that have had increased numbers of giant ragweed challenges this spring. So far, post-emergence programs in addition to glyphosate have cleaned up these populations. Be on the lookout for pigweed species that escape control.\\n\\nWe have been seeing increases in glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp across southwest Michigan. Palmer Amaranth continues to be a challenge, especially in portions of St. Joseph County.\\n\\nDry conditions are increasing concerns about typically what we consider to be later season pests, spider mites and soybean aphids . I have not observed either of these pests in fields this season. However, dry and dusty conditions tend to suppress fungal pathogens that keep these pests numbers low. Monitor dry corners on irrigated fields or areas along gravel roads or driveways for initial infestations.\\n\\nSoybean sudden death syndrome symptoms are becoming visible in southwest Michigan fields. Wet feet in soybean plants in early spring often increases chances for root rots. This springs prolonged wet conditions in May and June set the stage for sudden death syndrome infection. Up until recently, I have not seen substantial incidence of visual symptoms of the disease. However, the telltale yellow spots and yellowed areas with brown necrosis in soybean leaves are beginning to become visible in infected areas in fields.\\n\\nThere is no rescue treatment for the disease, only the opportunity to keep good field notes so you can select partially resistant varieties in future years when soybeans are being raised on the field again. It is also important to note that the disease can be spread by movement of soil from infected fields. Tillage equipment or other means where soil gets moved from field-to-field can spread sudden death syndrome to other fields in your operation. Power wash equipment as it comes out of fields to reduce the potential spread of this hard-to-control disease of soybean production.\\n\\nYellow spots and areas with brown necrosis in leaves are telltale symptoms of soybean sudden death syndrome.',\n",

The Teralytic probe contains 26 sensors, including the world’s first wireless NPK sensor, and its platform helps farmers produce more food with fewer resources by improving soil health in the fields. Probes are available worldwide and can be pre-ordered now through the Teralytic website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The collection of data in real-time allows growers to make more informed decisions regarding fertilization and irrigation,\" said Meagan Hynes, PhD, Teralytic\\'s VP of Soil Science. \"I\\'m also excited about the potential to use fertility and respiration data to evaluate soil health.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCombining a focus on soil health with AI, machine learning, and cloud technologies, Teralytic aims to reduce inputs and save farmers time by diagnosing the soils. \"While drone and camera-based technologies can find problems as they appear on the plants, Teralytic’s probe warns farmers of changes in the soils before they become problems,” said Steven Ridder, Founder and CEO of Teralytic.\\n\\n\\n\\nTraditionally, soil testing is a manual and time-intensive process that can take days or weeks.

Putting up high-quality hay is a balancing act that requires good timing, reliable equipment and a little bit of luck. Monitoring moisture levels in your hay crop throughout the production process can help harvest better, more consistent high-quality hay.\\n\\nHay and forage quality is a measure of characteristics affecting feed consumption and nutritive value.1 It has a big impact on livestock health and performance and, ultimately, the livestock producer’s feed bill. University of Missouri Extension specialists point to these factors as the greatest impact on hay quality:2\\n\\nMoisture content at baling and time of storage\\n\\nStage of maturity at baling\\n\\nStorage conditions\\n\\nThe forage species\\n\\nManage moisture to preserve dry matter\\n\\nAll forages lose dry matter as they cure, and losses begin at cutting. Using crimpers and crushers can greatly reduce dry matter loss while also reducing curing time in the swath for less exposure to weather, and less leaf shattering and respiration losses.2 Using Case IH ThirtyPlus™ hay preservative can help, too, by letting you bale hay with moisture content up to 30 percent without worrying about overheating or toxic molds.\\n\\nWhether you put up hay for your own livestock or market your hay off the farm, a moisture tester is invaluable in preserving the value of your crop. It helps take the guesswork out of testing moisture and reduces spoilage and lost revenue due to human error. It also helps reduce additional dry matter losses during raking and baling.\\n\\nCase IH moisture testers help you monitor moisture throughout the hay production process, all the way through feeding or marketing. Our portable moisture testers are designed to deliver reliable results in the windrow and in the bale. Case IH baler-mounted testers let you constantly monitor moisture and receive real-time in-cab feedback.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

He is well known to Canadian producers through his public appearances, articles, and through Sprayers101.com, the world’s most popular sprayer website. He will continue to offer independent information on application issues.\\n\\n“I’ve been watching both weed sensing and PWM with interest for over 20 years”, says Wolf. “I believe that this technology is part of agriculture’s future. It addresses many economic and agronomic needs of producers, while also advancing agriculture’s commitment to environmental protection.”\\n\\nWith PWM capability, the system allows a simultaneous broadcast spray of a low herbicide dose in the background, activating the full dose for larger weeds. This ensures that weeds too small to be detected are still controlled. The ability to selectively spray green material has additional potential in desiccation and pre-harvest treatments.\\n\\nWEEDit may be eligible for Canadian Agriculture Partnership (CAP) rebates in some provinces, reducing cost to producers.\\n\\n“Tramontana wants to emphasize a research and service focus with its introduction of WEEDit to Canada”, says Mellema. “We are committed to advancing the technology to meet our clients’ needs and to developing the necessary infrastructure to provide superior service as we grow in Western Canada.”\\n\\n“We are excited to welcome Tom and his team at Agrimetrix on the WEEDit team”, says Mellema. “With his help, we want to raise awareness of the advantages of precision spot spraying in agriculture.

To succeed, they must locate genes for high-yielding, hardy traits in crop plants’ DNA. A robot developed by the University of Illinois to find these proverbial needles in the haystack was recognized by the best systems paper award at Robotics: Science and Systems , the preeminent robotics conference held last week in Pittsburgh.\\n\\n“There’s a real need to accelerate breeding to meet global food demand,” said principal investigator Girish Chowdhary, an assistant professor of field robotics in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering and the Coordinated Science Lab at Illinois. “In Africa, the population will more than double by 2050, but today the yields are only a quarter of their potential.”\\n\\nCrop breeders run massive experiments comparing thousands of different cultivars, or varieties, of crops over hundreds of acres and measure key traits, like plant emergence or height, by hand. The task is expensive, time-consuming, inaccurate, and ultimately inadequate—a team can only manually measure a fraction of plants in a field.\\n\\n“The lack of automation for measuring plant traits is a bottleneck to progress,” said first author Erkan Kayacan, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But it’s hard to make robotic systems that can count plants autonomously: the fields are vast, the data can be noisy (unlike benchmark datasets), and the robot has to stay within the tight rows in the challenging under-canopy environment.”\\n\\nIllinois’ 13-inch wide, 24-pound TerraSentia robot is transportable, compact and autonomous. It captures each plant from top to bottom using a suite of sensors (cameras), algorithms, and deep learning. Using a transfer learning method, the researchers taught TerraSentia to count corn plants with just 300 images, as reported (DOI: 10.1002/rob.21794) at this conference.\\n\\n“One challenge is that plants aren’t equally spaced, so just assuming that a single plant is in the camera frame is not good enough,” said co-author ZhongZhong Zhang, a graduate student in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Science (ACES). “We developed a method that uses the camera motion to adjust to varying inter-plant spacing, which has led to a fairly robust system for counting plants in different fields, with different and varying spacing, and at different speeds.”\\n\\nThis work was supported by the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) as part of the TERRA-MEPP project at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. The robot is now available through the start-up company, EarthSense, Inc. which is equipping the robot with advanced autonomy and plant analytics capabilities.\\n\\nTERRA-MEPP is a research project that is developing a low-cost phenotyping robot to identify top-performing crops led by the University of Illinois in partnership with Cornell University and Signetron Inc. with support from the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Artificial Intelligence revolution is upon us, and agriculture will see wide-ranging effects. Many of agriculture’s hardest problems are being solved by companies with the right combination of data and the technical expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.\\n\\nMachine learning, which can be considered a subset of the broader trend in AI, has arisen from the confluence of several long-term trends in technology, most notably the proliferation of real-time measurements of physical systems (i.e., The Internet of Things) and the decreasing costs of cloud computing. The story of the development of a AI-powered irrigation product by our company, Tule, highlights the unique opportunities and challenges for machine learning solutions in agriculture.\\n\\nIoT + Cloud: sensors in the physical world transmit data to the cloud for processing and analysis. Machine learning systems enabled by powerful cloud computing systems produce insights accessible from computers and smartphones. The Internet of Things for evapotranspiration. This map shows Tule’s sensor network in one area of California. High density of sensors enables collection of measured ET data at unprecedented scale. An eddy covariance system, used for measuring evapotranspiration in academic research, is too complicated and expensive for growers to use. Tule’s sensor, which measures evapotranspiration with the surface renewal method, is used in large scale production agriculture by hundreds of growers.\\n\\nThe Challenge For Irrigation Managers and the Opportunity for Machine Learning\\n\\nUnderstanding the current water status of a field and predicting how it will respond to irrigation are problems that growers face every time they make an irrigation decision. Even veteran irrigation managers admit that the process is one of guesswork, and their guesses often miss the mark.\\n\\nA moisture release curve describes the relationship between available water in the soil and plant water status. Illustration from Dr. Ted Hsiao’s text on Plant-Water Relations.\\n\\nWhen water availability decreases, plants experience water stress. Corn leaf rolling is an example of a physiological response to water stress.\\n\\nTule’s site-specific MRC model shows growers how long until a field drops below the grower’s desired level of crop stress and provides irrigation recommendations that will keep a field within the desired stress range.\\n\\nEach farm field is a unique and complex biological system. Farm management operation decisions, such as fertilizer and irrigation applications, require careful consideration of the many interconnected pieces of agroecological information about each field. Therefore, farming decisions are ideal candidates for the application of machine learning, which excels at making sense of vast and complicated datasets.\\n\\nLet’s take irrigation decisions as an example. When irrigation managers talk about how they make irrigation decisions for a particular field, their method usually involves a combination of knowledge about the type of crop, information about the unique attributes of the field, and recent impressions about the field collected by their scouts. In their minds, they are building a mental model of each field that helps them understand the relationship between irrigation and the crop stress of the field. In plant science, that relationship is called a Moisture Release Curve.\\n\\nLeveraging its expansive dataset on daily water inputs (precipitation and irrigation), water outputs (measured ET), and crop stress, Tule developed a machine-learned Moisture Release Curve. (Note: Measured ET is the amount of water a crop field uses, whereas Reference ET, or ETo, which is a more familiar term to many growers, is an estimate of the water use of a well-watered lawn.) Like any machine learning model for agriculture, it had to meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbility to generalize: the model needs to be sufficiently complex to successfully capture the heterogeneity that is inherent to farming.\\n\\nSpeed of convergence: the model needs to provide useful predictions after a relatively short amount of time. A model that needs to be trained on an entire season’s worth of data for each field won’t be useful in practice.\\n\\nExplainability: In agriculture, it is important to be able to provide not just a prediction, but also to explain the “why” behind the prediction in order to help growers trust the data enough to act on it.\\n\\nTule’s AI-based Moisture Release Curve feature, called Water Stress Forecasts, gives growers the ability to quickly and easily see the influence of different irrigation timings and amounts on the future plant water status of their fields.\\n\\nThe Future of AI for Agriculture: More collaboration and more solutions',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Sarah Cato\\n\\nMultiple Arkansas farm operations implementing solar panels\\n\\nFinancial benefits seem to be substantial\\n\\nDivision of Agriculture could be jumping on the train\\n\\nSolar panels installed at the of farm of AJ Hood in Desha County, Arkansas, to power his grain storage facilities.\\n\\nFields across Arkansas seem to be sprouting solar panels as multiple growers take advantage of the one thing they can count on: the sun.\\n\\nSolar energy is catching on with Arkansas farmers, which is a trend that is very promising for the state, said Rick Cartwright, head of the Cooperative Extension Service for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.\\n\\n“I, for one, am very excited about the use of solar energy,” Cartwright said. “We used to talk about this when I was younger, but it just wasn’t practical and now that it is, I’m excited.”\\n\\nCartwright said he and others are cooking up plans to incorporate solar technology in the Division of Agriculture.\\n\\n“Solar technology is here,” he said. “Over time we’d like to figure out how to include it in our system and learn how to advise people in using it. For farmers, home owners and communities, we’re interested in any valid approach to helping them implement, not just solar technology, but other energy sources as well.”\\n\\nSolar panels on farms\\n\\nA.J. Hood of Desha County began using solar panels this season to power his grain storage facilities.\\n\\n“We started to look into solar energy about eight months ago,” Hood said. “We took the time to run the numbers and find out if this was going to be a good fit and when we looked at the long term benefits it was a no brainer. I really think this is going to catch on, it’s a great fit for growers in Arkansas.”\\n\\nAlthough the benefits seem to be large, Hood has allotted just a small amount of land to his solar panels.\\n\\n“I only have them on a little over an acre, that’s the beauty of it,” Hood said. “We have approximately 150 kilowatts of solar panels that produce approximately 240,000 kWh in electricity annually. That is enough to reduce our electricity cost by over 75 percent. It is a substantial savings for us and it makes our grain operation much more profitable. “\\n\\nTo get an idea of how much power that is, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,766 kWh in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This means that with the energy Hood’s solar panels produces in one year, he could power over 20 average American households for one year.\\n\\nSince implementing solar technology on his operation, Hood’s excitement is through the roof.\\n\\n“We can monitor our electricity production every minute of the day in real time, and I’ve become kind of obsessed with checking it,” Hood said. “I find myself running the numbers to see how much money I saved that day. As a farmer I’m used to praying for rain, but now I’m torn because I know those clouds are going to hurt my solar production!”\\n\\n“On a really good sunny day we can save as much as $80 a day based on our average cost of electricity,” Hood said. “It may not sound like a lot, but when you multiply that by 365 days it turns into some serious savings.”\\n\\nHis excitement is understandable. In a career where success depends on so many unpredictable factors, any constant can come as a relief. With solar panels, farmers can be protected from rising energy costs, and that security is a rare one.\\n\\n“Knowing that one of our largest variable expenses is now fixed for the next 30 years gives us peace of mind,” Hood said. “We now know we are insulated from rising energy costs and that’s a big deal for this type of operation. In farming we deal with a lot of variables that are out of our control. Any time you can take one of those off the table, it reduces our risk and we like that.”\\n\\nWhile the economics of it are reassuring, there are other bonuses that famers see. Wade Hill in Desha County came for the financial benefits, but stayed for the environmental impacts.\\n\\n“I heard the benefits of farm savings and that was my main reason up front,” Hill said. “But I’m really in this for the green energy aspects of it.”\\n\\nHill said he has dedicated an acre and a half of land to his solar panels and uses them to power his irrigation wells.\\n\\nOpening doors\\n\\nMany Arkansas growers are becoming pioneers for solar technology in their state, and it seems as though the trend is stretching beyond farming operations. The Vines Center, a conference center that hosts businesses, 4-H, schools and other groups, is investigating a move into solar power, said J.J. Pitman, 4-H center director.\\n\\n“At this point we are gathering information and researching options,” Pitman said. “Our hope is to reduce our use of traditional electricity. Lowering the cost of electricity will help provide more opportunities to further our mission of being a youth development campus. This will also reduce our carbon footprint.”\\n\\nMike Daniels, professor-water quality for the Division of Agriculture, said his operation is using solar panels to power automatic water samplers.\\n\\nAccording to USDA, more than 57,000 farm business and other farms produced renewable energy in 2012, with over 35,000 producing solar energy specifically. This is more than twice as many in 2007.',\n",

Peter Vitaliano reviews the half-year that was.\\n\\nWith half the year gone, dairy economist Peter Vitaliano of the National Milk Producers Federation has created an internal review so full of numbers it might give a non-economist a headache.\\n\\n\\n\\nHighlighter in hand, I read Vitaliano\\'s report, took two aspirin, and sat down with him to ask a few clarifying questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you were a meteorologist, not an economist, you might say the year was mostly sunny until June,\" said Vitaliano, who, in three decades of experience as a dairy economist, has seen ups and downs in global dairy markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then Mexico and China announced they would impose new, retaliatory tariffs on our dairy exports. That created big clouds of uncertainty, making the second half of 2018 difficult to forecast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking back on the first part of this year, what were some global economic highlights for U.S. dairy exporters?\\n\\n\\n\\nVitaliano cites these five:\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. exports hit a new volume record: U.S. dairy exports surged the first part of 2018, hitting an all-time volume high in April, breaking the previous month’s record. On a total milk solids basis, exports were equivalent to 18.8 percent of U.S. milk production. Volume was up 32 percent from April 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nProgress made toward \"The Next 5%\": As a percentage of U.S. production of milk solids, U.S. dairy exports increased from 14.0 percent in 2015 to 14.3 percent in 2016 and further to 14.6 percent in 2017. In the first four months of 2018, this share expanded to 16.8 percent. That is tangible progress toward \"The Next 5%,\" an industry goal to build U.S. dairy export volume from about 15 percent of U.S. milk solids to 20 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nMilk prices moved upward: By the early months of 2018, world prices for the major internationally traded dairy products had improved significantly from their low points of 2015-2016. … However, the new tariffs have the potential to erode some of that price improvement during the rest of 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nBakeries loved butterfat. The particularly strong price recovery for butter and anhydrous milkfat is due to robust demand for butterfat led by usage in the bakery sector in dairy-importing countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomic growth accelerated: The International Monetary Fund projects world economic growth will reach 3.9 percent in both 2018 and 2019, up slightly from 3.8 percent in 2017, which was the fastest worldwide growth since 2011.

Exports to China and Canada have also fallen due to increasing trade tensions.\\n\\nThe U.S. is expected to trade with other countries but the higher volume of pork supplies will weigh on domestic prices for the rest of the year, the report said.\\n\\nCanada\\n\\nIn Canada, pork production has declined due to productivity issues, weather-related plant closures, the lagged impact of PEDv and disruptive environmental controls, which has limited supply, the report noted.\\n\\nAlthough production may slow throughout the summer, it should gradually increase during the fall and winter.\\n\\nDomestic demand for pork has been supportive of prices but, with growing U.S. supplies, Rabobank analysts expect increased competition will pressure Canadian pork values.\\n\\nThe analysts also expect poor returns and soft demand from the U.S., which may limit growth of the Canadian sow herd this year.\\n\\nOverall, Canadian pork exports were down in April and a sharp fall in shipments to China reflects a surplus of pork in that market, the report said.\\n\\nHowever, Canada’s focus on developing a market in Japan has led to an increase in shipments to this high-value market.\\n\\nCanadian exports to Mexico have also picked up, following the American disruption, the report said. Canadian producers are expected to benefit from the trade tensions between the U.S. and Mexico, as Canada may provide less complicated logistics than some of its competitors.\\n\\nCanadian exports to China will improve due to the latter county’s trade tensions with the U.S., Rabobank analysts predict.',\n",

Tariffs have been imposed on U.S. imports, triggering counter-tariffs on U.S. exports with ag commodities a common target (see farmdoc daily April 17, 2018 for example). Existing trade agreements, notably NAFTA, have also been reopened. These events bring to mind the partial embargo of U.S. ag exports to the Soviet Union imposed on January 4, 1980 by President Jimmy Carter in response to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. It was lifted by President Ronald Reagan on April 24, 1981. This article examines U.S. exports of corn, soybeans, and wheat in long term perspective with a focus on the USSR grain embargo period. Its focus is U.S. exports to the world, not just to the USSR. Quantity of U.S. corn, soybean, and wheat exports were little impacted during the years of the USSR grain embargo, but declined in the years that followed. Moreover, U.S. corn and wheat exports have never really exceeded the quantity they reached in the early 1980s.\\n\\nBackground and Data\\n\\nThe USSR grain embargo of 1980 was a partial, not total embargo on a wide range of agricultural products, including grains, oilseeds, as well as meat and livestock products. Sales to the USSR remained large as previous trade commitments were honored. It is also important to note that it was the 4th U.S. embargo or moratorium on exports since 1973. The first was a ban on all exports of soybeans, cottonseed, and their products during the summer of 1973 in response to very high soybean prices and concern about domestic U.S. supplies. The second and third were U.S. moratoria on export sales to the USSR in 1974 and to the USSR and Poland in 1975 as a response to the U.S. drought of 1974 and USSR drought of 1975. While the USSR embargo of 1980 has garnered the most attention over time, it is more likely that 4 embargos / moratoria in a span of 7 years had a cumulative effect that exceeded their individual effect. For an extensive and excellent discussion of these embargos and moratoria, with a focus on the 1980 embargo, see the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service (ERS) report published in November 1986.\\n\\nThe data used in this study are U.S. and world exports of corn, soybeans, and wheat measured in million metric tons (MMTs). Source is “PSD online” (USDA, Foreign Agriculture Service). The analysis starts with the 1964/65 (1964) crop year, the first year data are reported for soybeans.\\n\\nU.S. Exports in Long Term Historical Perspective\\n\\nQuantity of U.S. exports of corn, soybeans and wheat rose by 373%, 67%, and 104%, respectively, from 1970 to 1980 (see Figure 1). Corn exports have never really exceeded the 61 MMTs exported during the 1979 crop year, although exports were slightly larger in 2007 at 62 MMTs. Wheat exports peaked at 48 MMTs in 1981, a level never approached since. Next highest year was 1987 at 43 MMTs. Soybean exports did not consistently exceed their late 1970/early 1980 level until the late 1990s. Peak exports are 59 MMTs in 2016.\\n\\nIn contrast to the U.S., exports of wheat by the rest-of-the-world (ROW) increased consistently after 1980 (see Figure 2). ROW soybean exports remained stable from 1980 through 1985, then began to increase consistently. The rate of increase accelerated after 1995 with China’s emergence as a major importer. ROW corn exports were erratic around their 1980 level until 1990, then began to increase. Interestingly, ROW corn and soybean export quantity have tracked one another since the mid-1990s.\\n\\nU.S. share of world corn and wheat exports rose during the 1970s (see Figure 3). U.S. soybean share began to decline after 1976 as South America emerged as an exporter. Since 1980, U.S. soybean and wheat share has declined fairly consistently at annual rates of -1.3 and -0.7 percentage points, respectively. Corn’s share declined erratically at a rate of -0.3 percentage point per year between 1980 and 2000. Decline has since accelerated to -2.2 percentage points per year, with decline particularly large from 2007 to 2011.\\n\\nUSSR Grain Embargo\\n\\nU.S. corn, soybean, and wheat exports were, respectively, 20%, 11%, and 25% higher in 1979-80 than in 1977-78 (see Figure 4). Wheat exports were the same in 1983-84 as 1979-80, but 1983-84 U.S. corn and soybean exports were less than in 1979-80 and even 1977-78. Corn and wheat exports in the pairs of years after 1984 were lower than in 1979-80. Soybean exports were higher, but only markedly so in 2016-17. The pairs of years, in chronological order, precede the embargo; cover the embargo years, immediately precede the 1985 farm bill’s substantial reduction in U.S. prices to stimulate demand, and then at roughly 10 year intervals.\\n\\nAs with quantity of U.S. soybean and wheat exports, U.S. share of world exports for these crops was higher in 1979-80 than 1977-78 (see Figure 5). U.S. corn export share was slightly lower in 1979-80, possibly due to the U.S. drought of 1980. By 1983-84, U.S. share was lower than even in 1977-78 for all 3 crops. Other than for corn in 1995-96, U.S. share is lower for all pairs of years since.\\n\\nThe USDA, ERS report of November 1986 concluded that, while international trade was rearranged, the embargos and moratoria had limited impact on the quantity of U.S. exports in the short run. While acknowledging the difficulty in assessing long-term impacts, it attributed most of the decline in U.S. exports that followed the 1980 USSR grain embargo to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar and a slowing of world economic growth. In addition, already high loan rates were raised for corn and wheat in the wake of the 1980 USSR grain embargo. As a result, U.S. policy provided an umbrella for the rest of the world to expand production. This umbrella remained in place until the 1985 farm bill substantially reduced loan rates. Clearly, all these factors would negatively impact U.S. exports. However, given (1) U.S. exports of corn and wheat have never exceeded early 1980 levels despite long term world economic growth, large fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, and the dramatic U.S. farm policy changes in 1985; (2) U.S. share of world exports for all 3 crops has continued to decline; and (3) nearly 40 instead of 5 years have passed; it is reasonable to ask whether the long term impact of the embargos and moratoria of the 1970s/1980s was more than this study suggests?\\n\\nSummary Observations',\n",

The beef production forecast is raised on higher expected cow slaughter in the third quarter. USDA will release the Cattle report on July 20th, providing a mid-year estimate of the U.S. cattle inventory as well as producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for beef cow replacement. Forecast pork production is raised from last month as higher expected second-half hog slaughter more than offsets lower second-quarter slaughter. A more rapid pace of hog slaughter is expected in the third quarter and USDA’s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated the March-May pig crop was 4 percent above 2017 which will result in higher fourth-quarter hog slaughter. Second and third-quarter broiler production is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights. Turkey production is raised slightly on production data to date. Egg production is raised from the previous month as egg prices are forecast higher and feed costs lower.\\n\\nFor 2019, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised as increases in pork and broiler production more than offsets expected declines in beef production. Forecast beef production is reduced from the previous month on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter the first half of the year. The pork production forecast is raised; the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated that producers intend to farrow 2 percent more hogs over the next two quarters, which coupled with expected growth in pigs per litter will push first-half hog slaughter higher. Forecast broiler and egg production is also raised from the previous month, as higher prices and lower expected feed prices support continued expansion. Forecast turkey production is unchanged from the previous month. The beef import forecast is unchanged for 2018, but the export forecast is raised from the previous month on recent trade data and continued strong exports to Asia. The 2019 beef export forecast is also raised from last month. Pork trade forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from the previous month. Lower pork product prices are expected to help offset increased competition in key markets in 2019. No change is made to 2018 and 2019 broiler and turkey export forecasts. The 2018 egg export forecast is raised on recent trade data, but no change is made to the outlying quarters. Small revisions are made to historical trade estimates. The cattle price forecast for 2018 is lowered slightly from last month, reflecting June price data. Forecast 2019 cattle prices are unchanged from the previous month. The hog price forecast is raised for 2018 as recent price strength and expected higher prices in the third quarter more than offset lower prices in the fourth quarter. The hog price forecast for 2019 is lowered on increased supplies of pork. Broiler prices are raised for 2018 on current price strength while turkey prices are unchanged. No changes are made for 2019 broiler and turkey price forecasts. Egg prices are raised for 2018 on higher-than-expected prices to date. The 2019 egg price is reduced slightly on increased supplies.\\n\\nMilk production forecasts for both 2018 and 2019 are lowered from last month on slower-thananticipated growth in milk per cow and lower cow numbers. Although tempered by lower expected feed costs, lower milk prices will likely weaken producer margins, resulting in lower cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow. USDA’s Cattle report, to be released on July 20th, will provide a midyear estimate of dairy cow and dairy replacement heifer inventories.\\n\\nFor 2018, the fat basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on higher imports of butterfat products. Fat basis imports are unchanged for 2019. The 2018 fat basis export forecast is unchanged from the previous month but is raised for 2019 as the U.S. is expected to be price competitive and higher expected exports of butterfat products will more than offset expected declines in cheese exports. Skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from the previous month. However, skim-solids basis exports for 2018 and 2019 are reduced from the previous month primarily on lower expected exports of skim milk powder and whey products as China’s tariffs on certain U.S. dairy products hampers exports to some extent.\\n\\nThe 2018 butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month. Forecasts are reduced for cheese, NDM, and whey prices for 2019 as cheese stocks will remain large and prices for NDM and whey will have to remain competitive with competing exporters. However, the 2019 butter price is raised as stocks are worked down. The 2018 and 2019 Class III price and Class IV price forecasts are lowered from last month. The 2018 all milk price is forecast at $15.95 to $16.25 and the price for 2019 is $16.25 to $17.25 per cwt.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Dorivar Ruiz Diaz\\n\\nWhen crop fields appear variable, one question commonly asked is whether this is due to a nutrient problem. An excellent tool that can be used to answer this question is plant analysis or tissue testing.\\n\\nAs with corn, wheat, and other crops, there are two primary ways plant analysis can be used: as a routine monitoring tool to ensure nutrient levels are adequate in the plant in normal or good looking crops, and as a diagnostic tool to help explain some of the variability and problems we see in soybean growth and appearance in fields.\\n\\nPlant analysis as a routine monitoring tool\\n\\nFor monitoring nutrient levels purposes, collect 20-30 sets of the upper, fully developed trifoliate leaves, less the petiole, at random from the field anytime between flowering and initial pod set (growth stages R1-4). The top fully developed leaves are generally the dark green leaves visible at the top of the canopy, which are attached at the second or third node down from the top of the stem.\\n\\nSampling later, once seed development begins, will give lower nutrient contents since the soybean plant begins to translocate nutrients from the leaves to the developing seed very quickly. Sampling leaf tissue under severe stress conditions for monitoring purposes can also give misleading results and is not recommended.\\n\\nThe sampled leaves should be allowed to wilt overnight to remove excess moisture, placed in a paper bag or mailing envelope, and shipped to a lab for analysis. Producers should not place the leaves in a plastic bag or other tightly sealed container, as they will begin to rot and decompose during transport, and the sample won\\'t be usable.\\n\\nWhich nutrients should you request analysis?\\n\\nIn Kansas, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) are the nutrients most likely to be deficient in soybeans. Normally the best values are the “bundles” or “packages” of tests offered through many of the labs. The packages can be as simple as N, P and K, or can consist of all of the 14 mineral elements considered essential to plants. K-State offers a package that includes N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn for $32.00.\\n\\nThe data returned from the lab will be reported as the concentration of nutrient elements, or potentially toxic elements in the plants. Units reported will normally be in terms of “percent” for the primary and secondary nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) and “ppm,” or parts per million, for the micronutrients (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, B, Mo, and Al). Most labs/agronomists compare plant nutrient concentrations to published sufficiency ranges. A sufficiency range is simply the range of concentrations normally found in healthy, productive plants during surveys. A diagram explaining this concept is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 1. Example of plant analysis interpretation using the concept of a sufficiency range.\\n\\nTable 1 gives the range of nutrient content considered to be \"normal\" or \"sufficient\" for top, fully developed soybean leaves at early pod set. Keep in mind that these are the ranges normally found in healthy, productive soybeans.\\n\\nTable 1. Nutrient content considered “normal” or “sufficient” for soybeans\\n\\nNutrient Units Growth Stage\\n\\n(Top, fully developed leaves at pod set) Nitrogen % 4.25-5.50 Phosphorus % 0.25-0.5 Potassium % 1.70-2.50 Calcium % 0.35-2.00 Magnesium % 0.26-1.00 Sulfur % 0.15-0.50 Copper ppm 10-30 Iron ppm 50-350 Manganese ppm 20-100 Zinc ppm 20-50 Boron ppm 20-55 Molybdenum ppm 1.0-5.0 Aluminum ppm <200\\n\\nPlant analysis as a diagnostic tool\\n\\nPlant analysis is an excellent diagnostic tool to help understand some of the variation seen in the field. When using plant analysis to diagnose field problems, producers should try to take comparison samples from both good/normal areas of the field, and problem areas. Collect soil samples from the same good and bad areas, and don’t wait for flowering to sample soybeans. Early in the season, when plants are 8-10 inches tall, collect whole plants from 15 to 20 different places in the sampling areas. Later in the season, collect 20-30 sets of top, fully developed leaves. Handle the samples the same as those for monitoring, allowing them to wilt to remove excess moisture, and avoiding mailing in plastic bags.\\n\\nSoil samples are important in diagnostic work, because while a plant may be deficient in a nutrient, it may not be due to a shortage in the soil. Other factors such as soil compaction, insect or disease damage to the roots, low pH limiting nodulation, or many other issues can limit nutrient uptake in soybeans.\\n\\nPlant samples can be sent to the K-State Soil Testing Laboratory for analysis at:\\n\\nK-State Research and Extension\\n\\n2308 Throckmorton PSC\\n\\n1712 Claflin Rd.\\n\\nManhattan, KS 66506-5503\\n\\nFor more information on plant analysis testing, including available tests, forms, and costs, please visit the K-State Soil Testing Lab website at:\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIn summary, plant analysis is a good tool producers can use to monitor the sufficiency of soil fertility levels and inoculant effectiveness, and a very effective diagnostic tool. Producers should consider adding this to their toolbox.',\n",

The roots of the trade war between the two countries are linked to “China’s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its forced technology transfers,” Dave Warner, NPPC’s director of communications, said to Farms.com today.\\n\\nAnd China already had a 12 per cent tariff on U.S. pork.\\n\\nChina represents an important market for American pork producers, as the country accounted for 17 per cent of the total value of U.S. exports last year.\\n\\nAs of Friday, American producers also face a 10 percent tariff increase from Mexico, raising that country’s total tax to 20 per cent.\\n\\n“Both of those markets are very important to U.S. pork producers,” Warner said.\\n\\n“Mexico is the U.S. pork industry’s number two export market, taking $1.5 billion (worth) of U.S. pork in 2017, and China is the number three export market, importing $1.1 billion last year.”\\n\\nEconomists from Iowa State University calculated that, from March through to May, producers lost $18 per hog or more than $2 billion on an annualized basis, the release said.\\n\\n“The Trump administration has said it will help farmers hurt by the ongoing trade disputes, but it remains to be seen the form that will take,” Warner said.\\n\\n“One possible action, which has been used by USDA in the past, is a supplemental purchase of pork for federal food programs, such as for the military, federal prisons and the needy.”\\n\\nThe American government has also helped pork producers by opening new markets in Argentina and Paraguay. “They aren’t huge markets, but every little bit helps, and Argentina … has great growth potential,” Warner added.\\n\\nNPPC continues to urge the administration to end the trade disputes as soon as possible and to do whatever it can to help America’s farmers. The organization also advocates for the maintenance and expansion of existing export markets, and the opening of new ones.\\n\\nPrevious Farms.com coverage on retaliatory tariffs can be found here.\\n\\nRGtimeline/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

In addition, demand will likely be weakened by reduced exports with tariffs in place on U.S. pork exports to China and Mexico. On a positive note, Chinese tariffs on U.S. grains and soybeans are helping to erode feed prices along with favorable growing season weather.\\n\\nThe industry has expanded the breeding herd by three percent according to a recent producer survey by USDA. This is the highest rate of breeding herd expansion since this expansion phase began in 2015. A breeding herd of this magnitude is likely to be a primary contributor to excess supplies in 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nThe market herd was up three percent and farrowing intentions for this summer and fall were up two percent. With the breeding herd up three percent, there is concern that actual farrowings this summer and fall could be higher than the two percent increase recorded by survey respondents.\\n\\nPork supplies will be large. First-half supplies this year have been up four percent and are expected to rise to five percent higher in the third quarter this summer and four percent higher in the final quarter of 2018. Current expected supplies for the first-half of 2019 are up four percent and three percent in the last-half of 2019.\\n\\nThe second driver of the large losses facing the pork industry revolve around the current trade war the U.S. has entered. The U.S. pork industry has done an amazing job of producing low costs and high value pork products and adapting them to our foreign customers. As a result we have targeted exports as a strategic objective to grow the U.S. pork industry. Our success in growing exports to 22 percent of production means that pork became a target of both China and Mexico.\\n\\nPork exports started the year with a lot of promise being up nine percent at the end of April compared to the January to April period last year. Chinese tariffs on U.S. pork began on April 2 and were raised again on July 6 making additional tariffs of at least 50 percent. Mexico placed tariffs on U.S. pork of ten percent on June 5, and raised those to 20 percent on July 5.\\n\\nWeekly export data from USDA suggests a sharp drop in pork export sales during the month of June representing about a 25 percent decrease from last year. Weakness in exports will be expected as long as the tariffs stay in place. China has also placed tariffs on U.S. beef and poultry which may reduce U.S. exports of these competitive meats.\\n\\nJust how large are the loss prospects right now considering the large pork supplies, reduced exports due to tariffs, and reduced feed prices due to tariffs and favorable growing conditions?\\n\\nLiveweight prices for 51-52 percent lean carcasses are expected to average about $49 in the third quarter of 2018 before dropping sharply in the last quarter to near $40. Current estimates of cost of production are near $50.\\n\\nIn 2019, prices are expected to be below costs for much of the year. Liveweight prices are expected to be in the low $40’s in the first quarter and then move to near $50 for averages in the second and third quarter before dropping back to the low $40’s for the final quarter.\\n\\nEstimated losses are expected to be large this fall and winter with losses averaging about $25 per head for this six month period. Hog prices may be close to breakeven in the second and third quarters before returning to losses greater than $20 per head in the last quarter of 2019. Losses for the calendar year of 2018 are estimated at a loss of $10 per head and $12 per head of loss in 2019.\\n\\nFeed costs are expected to be somewhat lower in the second-half of 2018 versus the first-half. This is especially true for soybean meal where Decatur, Illinois prices for high protein meal were near $365 per ton in the first-half. That same price in the second-half is expected to be closer to $340 per ton. Unfortunately, corn costs may be similar in both halves of the year and thus the modestly lower feed costs are not enough to offset low hog prices.\\n\\nMy prices for hogs and feed are primarily based on futures prices on July 9. Clearly, agricultural product markets are in a period of high uncertainty and volatility. Weather will continue to be a driver of crop prices over the next six to eight weeks. What happens to tariffs on U.S. exports of crops and animal products will also add dynamic price potential.\\n\\nGiven the heightened level of uncertainty, most pork producers will not want to make long-term decisions at this point. That means carrying on as best they can with short-term plans. The current trade war that agriculture has been unwillingly forced to participate in has an unknown and difficult to predict outcome. Only time will help bring the “end game” into better focus.',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Rachel Purdy and Michael Langemeier\\n\\nCenter for Commercial Agriculture\\n\\nPurdue University\\n\\nExamining the competitiveness of wheat production in different regions of the world is often difficult due to lack of comparable data and consensus regarding what needs to be measured. To be useful, international data needs to be expressed in common production units and converted to a common currency. Also, production and cost measures need to be consistently defined across production regions or farms.\\n\\nThis paper examines the competitiveness of wheat production for important international wheat regions using 2013 to 2016 data from the agri benchmark network. Earlier work examined international benchmarks for the 2013 to 2015 period (farmdoc daily September 23, 2016). The agri benchmark network collects data on beef, cash crops, dairy, pigs and poultry, horticulture, and organic products. There are 38 countries represented in the cash crop network. The agri benchmark concept of typical farms was developed to understand and compare current farm production systems around the world. Participant countries follow a standard procedure to create typical farms that are representative of national farm output shares, and categorized by production system or combination of enterprises and structural features.\\n\\nThe sample of farms used in this paper was comprised of ten typical farms from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and United States. The farm and country abbreviations used in this paper are listed in table 1. Typical farms used in the agri benchmark network are defined using country initials and hectares on the farm. It is important to note that wheat enterprise data is collected from other countries. These seven countries represented in table 1 were selected to simplify the illustration of costs and discussion. There are three U.S. farms with wheat in the network. The U.S. farms used to illustrate wheat production in this paper is the western Kansas farm (US2025KS) and the southern Indiana farm (US1215INS).\\n\\nAll of the typical farms listed in table 1 produced multiple crops. The Argentine farm produced soybeans, corn, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The Australian farm produced barley, fodder, rapeseed, and summer wheat. The Canadian farm located in the Red River Valley produced barley, rapeseed, soybeans, summer wheat, and winter wheat. The Canadian farm located in Saskatchewan produced linseed, oats, peas, rapeseed, barley, and summer wheat. The German farm produced rapeseed, sugar beets, and winter wheat. The smaller Ukraine farm produced corn, rapeseed, soybeans, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The larger Ukraine farm produced corn, soybeans, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The southern Indiana farm produced corn, soybeans, and winter wheat. The production of winter wheat on the southern Indiana farm enables this farm to produce double-crop soybeans. The Kansas farm produced corn (both irrigated and non-irrigated) and winter wheat.\\n\\nWheat Yields\\n\\nAlthough yield is only a partial gauge of performance, it reflects the available production technology across farms. Average wheat yield for the farms in 2013 to 2016 was 66.8 bushels per acre (4.49 metric tons per hectare). Figure 1 illustrates average wheat yield per hectare for each typical farm. Average farm yields ranged from approximately 30.3 bushels per acre (2.04 metric tons per hectare) for the typical farm in Australia to 138.8 bushels per acre (9.33 metric tons per hectare) for the German farm. The Indiana farm had an average yield of 64.8 bushels per acre (4.36 metric tons per hectare) while the Kansas farm had an average yield of 40.6 bushels per acre (2.73 metric tons per hectare).\\n\\nInput Cost Shares\\n\\nDue to differences in technology adoption, input prices, fertility levels, efficiency of farm operators, trade policy restrictions, exchange rate effects, and labor and capital market constraints, input use varies across typical wheat farms. Figure 2 presents the average input cost shares for each farm. Cost shares were broken down into three major categories: direct costs, operating costs, and overhead costs. Direct costs included seed, fertilizer, crop protection, crop insurance, and interest on these cost items. Operating cost included labor, machinery depreciation and interest, fuel, and repairs. Overhead cost included land, building depreciation and interest, property taxes, general insurance, and miscellaneous cost.\\n\\nThe average input cost shares were 37.3 percent for direct cost, 37.4 percent for operating cost, and 25.4 percent for overhead cost. The Kansas farm had an above average cost share for direct cost at 40.1 percent, and a below average cost share for operating cost and overhead cost. Crop establishment costs are a large proportion of direct cost. The Indiana farm had an above average cost share for overhead cost at 45.3 percent and a below average cost share for direct costs and operating cost. The German farm also had a relatively high cost share for overhead cost. The relatively large cost share for overhead cost in Indiana and Germany largely reflects relatively high land costs. The Indiana farm had the smallest cost share for operating cost out of the sample analyzed at 18 percent.\\n\\nFigures 3 and 4 present seed, fertilizer, and pesticide cost per hectare and per ton for each of the typical farms. Compared to the U.S. farms, seed and fertilizer costs per hectare are relatively low in Australia. As noted above, the German farm had, by far, the highest yield per hectare. However, its establishment cost ($461 per hectare) is more than 80 percent above the average of the typical farms in the sample. Of the farms selected, the German farm had the highest seed, pesticide, and fertilizer costs per hectare. On a per hectare basis, the Indiana farm had the lowest pesticide cost, but this farm also had the highest seed cost. The Indiana farm’s pesticide costs were approximately 40 percent below the average.\\n\\nRevenue and Cost\\n\\nFigures 5 and 6 present average gross revenue and cost per hectare and per ton for each typical farm. Gross revenue and cost are reported as U.S. dollars per hectare and per ton. Wheat is a major enterprise on all of the typical farms presented in figures 5 and 6. It is obvious from figures 5 and 6 that gross revenue per hectare and per ton are substantially higher for the German farm. However, cost is also substantially higher for this farm. In fact, the German farm had the highest direct cost, operating cost, and overhead cost per hectare. However, on a per ton basis, the German farm had below average direct and operating cost, and above average overhead cost.\\n\\nThree of the selected typical farms had a negative economic profit during the 2013 to 2016 time period. Average losses for the typical farms from Argentina, Indiana, and Kansas were $57, $101, and $4 per acre, respectively during the four year period ($140, $249, $9 per hectare, respectively). The highest economic profit earned was $60 per acre ($148 per hectare) for the typical Russia farm. Despite having the lowest gross revenue per acre at $172 ($425 per hectare), the Australian farm had an average economic profit of $8 per acre ($20 per hectare) during the four-year period.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThis paper examined yield, gross revenue, and cost for farms with a wheat enterprise in the agri benchmark network from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and United States. Although the typical German farm had the highest yields, that farm also realized the highest seed, pesticide, and fertilizer costs per hectare. Both of the farms in the United States realized an economic loss during the 2013 to 2016 time period.',\n",

Farmers can use CTIS to control tire pressures from their tractor cabs.\\n\\nThe CTIS capabilities allow the tires to operate at low pressure rates, which have added benefits, said David Graden, agriculture operational marketing manager for Michelin.\\n\\n“The tires have exceptional field traction and performance,” he told Farms.com today. “They can run as low as 9 psi in singles and 6 psi at field operating speeds in duals.”\\n\\nAside from traction benefits, operating at the AxioBib2 tires at low psi levels may also help growers increase yields, Graden said.\\n\\n“The University of Illinois did a study on soil compaction and impact on yield,” he said. “Researchers have seen about a 4.3 percent yield gain in corn by using Michelin tires.”\\n\\nProducers should take a practical approach to selecting tires.\\n\\nMuch like purchasing a car, testing the tires before buying them will give farmers an idea of how the tires handle and if they will be a worthwhile investment.\\n\\n“Farmers are getting hit with everything at every angle,” Graden said. “Go drive on the tire, tell us what you think and how you feel about it. It’s the best way to know if the tire is right for your equipment or your farm.”\\n\\nThe AxioBib2 is available in 710/60R42 and 600/60R30 sizes. More sizes will be available in 2019.\\n\\nMichelin also introduced its CrossGrip radial tire for road, grass and snowy conditions.\\n\\nThe tire is designed for loaders, backhoes, telehandlers and tractors. It has 196 tread blocks per wheel rotation and an optimized tread depth to reduce damage during the growing season.\\n\\nFarmers can purchase the CrossGrip as of Aug. 1. The tires are available in 250/80R16, 400/80R24, 440/80R24 and 440/80R28 sizes.\\n\\nMichelin photo',\n",

FCC also increased lending in the agri-food and agribusiness sector, supporting young entrepreneurs and helping business operators become leaders in job creation and innovation.\\n\\n“Innovation spurs increased productivity and competitiveness,” Hoffort said. “We understand the needs of our customers across the agriculture value chain, from primary producers to the agribusiness and agri-food companies that create value-added products for Canadian and global markets.”\\n\\nLooking ahead, FCC has set its sights on advancing its public policy role by contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive agriculture and agri-food industry. The federal Crown corporation is launching initiatives to advance mental health awareness in agriculture, developing financing and business support for women entrepreneurs, and exploring ways to involve more indigenous people and communities in the industry.\\n\\n“By helping primary producers and agri-food operators achieve their full potential, FCC is enabling the industry to create more opportunities for a broader range of people who can bring fresh ideas and new energy to Canadian agriculture and agri-food,” Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay said. “At the same time, FCC is contributing to our government’s ambitious goal of increasing agri-food exports to $75 billion by 2025.”\\n\\nIn 2017-18, FCC support programs were provided last year for Ontario and Quebec customers impacted by excessive moisture and, more recently, New Brunswick and Quebec maple syrup producers and Maritimes fruit and vegetable producers impacted by unfavorable weather this spring.\\n\\nFCC also gave back almost $4 million through community investment initiatives, launched the Ignite summit for young farmers, offered a wide range of Ag Knowledge Exchange learning events attracting more than 15,000 participants and raised an equivalent of 7.2 million meals in conjunction with its like-minded partners through the FCC Drive Away Hunger tour in support of food banks across Canada. It also continues to support groups, such as 4-H Canada, Ag in the Classroom, the Canadian Agricultural Safety Association, STARS air ambulance service and numerous industry associations.\\n\\n“Our role goes well beyond loan transactions,” Hoffort said. “We look forward to continuing our support for young and new entrants, enabling intergenerational transfers of family farms and supporting the growth of our customers and the industry.”\\n\\nOther 2017-18 financial highlights include:\\n\\nNet income of $669.9 million, to be reinvested in agriculture through funding new loans and developing agriculture knowledge, products and services for customers.\\n\\nA dividend of $308.3 million paid by FCC to the Government of Canada.\\n\\nA healthy loan portfolio with the allowance for credit losses remaining steady, reflecting a strong and vibrant industry.\\n\\nStrong debt-to-equity and total capital ratios, indicating continued financial strength and an ongoing ability to serve the agriculture and agri-food industry.\\n\\nFCC continues to provide free learning opportunities and economic insights through events, web, social media and various publications for all involved with the industry.\\n\\nSource : FCC',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Alvaro Garcia\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough belonging to the family Bovidae (bison, cattle, sheep, etc.), and sharing some characteristics with their ruminant cousins, goats are unique. They are represented worldwide by two genus: Oreamnos and Capra. The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) resides in the American Northwest. The wild goat (Capra aegagrus) has a widespread distribution ranging from Europe and Asia Minor to Central Asia and the Middle East and is considered the ancestor of the domestic goat. Domestication of goats has been going on for thousands of years and it apparently started in the Persian Empire (today’s Iran), and Asia. Through centuries of selection the domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) resulted to date in 165 breeds (dairy and meat) recognized worldwide. One of their characteristics is that, similar to their ancestors, they have retained the ability to thrive in harsh environments; granted, modern breeds selected for high production will need more feed than under maintenance conditions. Goats are termed browsers because of their selective feeding habits, that is they like to choose. They are also extremely fond of leaves (shrubs and trees) and thus some also label them as folivores (“leaf eaters”). However, nothing is definite with goats; if they find a nice pasture they will graze particularly relishing prickly weeds that grow in it! If these characteristics were not enough to admire, goats are also very hardy when it comes to weather extremes. They originate from environments that are very hot during the day but can be freezing at night. If there is one thing goats particularly dislike however is to get wet! There is one other aspect besides their natural biological advantages, and that is their temperament. When walking in the field they will follow their owner to a different feeding station, and enjoy this interaction in the meantime.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Goats in the Upper Midwest?\\n\\nThe short introduction above helps better understand why we can successfully raise goats in this region. Their adaptability to different environmental conditions makes them an excellent choice for small acreages and or land where crops do not prosper without significant investments in equipment or soil amendments. To optimize productivity and profitability without taxing the environment there is an adage worth considering: “It makes more sense to adapt the genetics to the environment than to modify this one to accommodate certain genetics”. This goes for both plant and animal genetics. For centuries man has modified the land so species less adapted to it can prosper. This practice is becoming increasingly expensive and oftentimes detrimental to the environment. The map shows that west of the Missouri river the moisture storage capacity is low compared to the east. Even during years of normal rainfall there can be short-term dry spells that affect crops.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoil moisture storage capacity helps determine drought vulnerability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Soil moisture capacity is lower in areas with shallower soils and soils that contain high clay content. A lower soil moisture capacity limits the ability of the soil to store winter and early spring precipitations for use by crops during the summer growing months. The counties in this map are clipped to show cropland only. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using characteristics data from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Soil Survey Geographic Database, 2010.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the Great Plains have always been considered a semi-arid area of the U.S. This Region is characterized by hot, relatively short summers, and usually cold, dry winters. Annual precipitation increases by almost 70 percent between the Western (East of the Rockies) and Eastern ends of the Region. Potential moisture losses by evapotranspiration also increase by almost 400 percent between the Northern (Canadian border) and the Southern extremes. In addition to these moisture gradients, agricultural production is challenged by high climate variability interspersed with periods of severe precipitation shortages. Susceptibility to drought is not only determined by the yearly precipitation but also by the moisture storage capacity of the different types of soil.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoats however can easily adapt to the variable environmental and foraging conditions of this region with only minor management strategies in order to meet their requirements. Their foraging behavior will more than likely allow them to prosper in parts of the state while they take care of most of the weeds. Granted, there will be a need for mineral supplementation as well as some grain for higher producing animals. Similarly, if forage is extremely scarce or during the winter months, hay and grain supplementation will also be needed. Fresh clean water should always be available; goats have a very keen sense of smell and will reluctantly drink dirty or off-flavored water. Finally, and as far as “accommodations” go, just remember they need protection from the rain, wind, and potential predators (dogs, coyotes, etc.).\\n\\n\\n\\nChoosing the Right Goats\\n\\nThe most common dairy goat breeds registered with the American Dairy Goat Association are: Nubian, LaMancha, Alpine, Oberhasli, Toggenburg, Saanen, Sable, and Nigerian Dwarf. Choosing the right breed is more of a personal preference between milk volume, milk solids, better resistance to environmental conditions or just looks. Regardless of the decision, there are local farms that successfully keep any of these breeds in the Upper Midwest. This article is not meant to delve the advantage of each breed. It is worth noting however that Saanens are considered the “Holsteins” of the goat world because of their high milk production; Nubians and Nigerian Dwarfs on the other hand produce less milk, however much more concentrated in solids, particularly fat and protein. The remaining breeds productivity is somewhere between both extremes and varies on individual goats depending on their genetics and management. Granted, one could choose not to work with pure breeds but incorporating the desirable characteristics of two or more breeds through crossbreeding. The offspring of crosses between a breed characterized by high milk production (for example Saanen) with another with more milk solids, will usually result in animals that may produce less milk volume, but with more solids than the original Saanen. This first generation of animals will show what has been described as “hybrid vigor” with excellent production, breeding, and adaptability to their environment. Over time though, when they are crossed back to any of the two parental breeds it is difficult to maintain the positive traits of this first cross, and the productive advantages of the first crossbreds are slowly lost.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the decision of the breed has been made then it comes the search for the individual animals. An acceptable milk production is obviously the individual trait producers usually look for first. Since it is an inheritable trait transmitted by both parents to the doelings, it is important to verify milk records whenever possible. This does not mean that in absence of records one cannot choose animals based on their conformation and current milk production. When choosing virgin doe yearlings, it is highly recommendable to take a look at their dam and its overall conformation, particularly the udder. Udders should be adequately attached, look full when in lactation, both teats centered and of adequate size. Some does may develop disproportionally large (wide) teats, one or even both. This ends up becoming a problem when milking by hand and even with a milking machine. It is sometimes the result of kids being allowed to suckle, if they show preference for one teat over the other. A possible explanation of this preference is that a thinner teat canal in one teat that does not allow for an easy milk flow discourages the kid(s) to suckle that teat with milking accumulating in the teat cistern and progressively stretching it. Make sure kids suckle alternatively from both teats and if not, milk out the one that’s being refused. The other very important aspect is udder attachment. In lactating does udders should be adequately attached to the abdomen by strong ligaments. This is apparent in heavy producers and particularly from their second lactation on. Well-attached udders should be high, with both teat ends not surpassing a horizontal line drawn through the hocks. Extremely low udders can lead to udder or teat injuries which if deep enough can progress into fatal mastitis cases. The topline of the body should be straight (withers to rump) with some goats showing a slight slope from the withers to the rump. One other important aspect is to verify that the hoofs are trimmed regularly; badly trimmed or untrimmed hoofs can lead to painful lameness that will reduce feed intake and milk production.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf checking an adequate conformation is important, making sure the goats are free from a couple of critical diseases is crucial. If kept properly, goats are quite sturdy when it comes to ailments that may affect them. When purchasing the initial stock however, one needs to be fairly strict with a couple of diseases that they may bring with them: Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis (or CAE) and Caseous lymphadenitis (CL). The first one is viral in nature, it is specific to goats, and it is transmitted to each other via infected colostrum, milk, or blood. Symptoms are not apparent in goats except for five clinical presentations including arthritis (the most common, and usually observed after 6 months of age), encephalitis, interstitial pneumonia, mastitis, and progressive weight loss. Goats may show joint stiffness, shifting leg lameness, decreased ambulation, weight loss, reluctance to rise, and abnormal posture. Acute swelling of the joint is also possible which may lead to arthritis. The encephalitic (brain) form of CAE affects kids 2 to 6 months of age, which show signs of incoordination and inappropriate placement of limbs while walking which can progressively develop into paralysis. The interstitial pneumonia is characterized by chronic cough, labored breathing, and weight loss. In adult does mastitis can be observed usually around kidding time; it is characterized by a firm udder with difficult or no milk ejection. It is a sound practice to ask for negative CAE blood analysis tests before purchasing goats. The second disease or Caseous Lymphadenitis (CL), also called pseudotuberculosis, or just “abscesses”, is a chronic contagious disease affecting sheep and goats. It is bacterial in nature (Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis) characterized by swelling, rupture, and pus draining from affected peripheral subcutaneous lymph nodes. It can be detected by palpating enlarged lymph nodes under the skin in the angle of the mandible, right at the base of the neck and before the scapula (shoulder blade), right before the femur & tibia joint (stifle joint), and supra-mammary (above the udder) right behind the rear legs. This bacterium can survive in the environment for a minimum of one year, and it is usually spread through cuts during shearing, fences, and feeders. This disease has the potential to be transferred to humans (zoonosis) so affected animals and their lesions should be handled with surgical gloves. Treatment involves draining the pus from the abscesses and using a 7% iodine solution to flush them. Of course there are other ailments that can affect goats and that can be treated by their owner if minor or that may need veterinary attention. The two described above however, are in my opinion, the two most important to start a goat herd with the right foot.\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging the Herd\\n\\nOnce the right location, breed, and animals are identified, it is time to think about how to manage the herd. Since this is about small-scale let’s assume 10 lactating does.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s suppose we have decided to buy 10 alpines with an adult body weight of roughly 140 pounds each. Depending on the standing forage available, this number of animals can easily be kept in 1-2 acres of foraging area. Granted, one could have more animals (or less surface area) if they are supplemented with forage and grain. The author has kept up to 20 goats in a little less than one acre with the caveat that it was a spot with very lush forage growth with plenty of brome, reed canary grass, and other palatable forbs. There were also plenty of weeds; at least initially, since the goats gradually took care of most of them! Goats are grazed in this unfenced pasture under supervision, since the neighbor rotated corn and beans and goats were fond of both!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Live cyanobacterial blooms can be green, but also red or yellow, and often turn blue after the bloom dies and dries on the surface or shoreline.”\\n\\nSome species of cyanobacteria can be toxic when livestock and wildlife ingest them. Toxicity is dependent on the species consuming the water, the concentration of the toxin or toxins and the amount of water ingested.\\n\\nCyanobacteria can produce neuro and liver toxins.

In animals, symptoms include weakness, staggering, muscle tremors, difficulty in breathing, convulsions and, ultimately, death.\\n\\nAnimals affected by liver toxins may exhibit weakness, pale-colored mucous membranes, mental derangement, bloody diarrhea and, ultimately, death. Typically, livestock are found dead before producers observe symptoms.

Many producers equate baling hay with hot summer days and a rush to beat the weather. While getting the hay baled and off the field is understandably a priority, doing the job safely should remain top of mind.\\n\\n“To increase the safety of baling procedures while ensuring the job gets done, look for hazards related to baler operation, handling, transporting and stacking,” says Kenda Lubeck, farm safety awareness coordinator with Alberta Agriculture and Forestry.\\n\\n“Once you identify hazards, make the necessary changes to ensure the safety of all workers.”\\n\\nThe following are some of the hazards.\\n\\nHandling:\\n\\nEnsure no children play near hay balers, carriers, and stackers.\\n\\nProperly train workers operating tractors, front-end loaders or forklifts.\\n\\nTractors with cabs, FOPS (falling object protective structure) or four-poster ROPS (roll-over protective structure) used to lift round bales are essential.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Geoff Geddes, for Swine Innovation Porc\\n\\nUntil they grow opposable thumbs and get milk from the fridge like the rest of us, piglets rely on sows for their daily supply. And just as kids are told to drink their milk so they’ll grow up big and strong, consumption early in life is essential to piglet development. That was the impetus for the project “Maximizing mammary development”, part of a series of studies aimed at improving sow milk yield and piglet growth.\\n\\n“We know that if we take a baby pig and feed it milk through a bottle in addition to what the sow gives it, the pig grows more,” said Dr. Chantal Farmer, Research Scientist -Swine Lactation Biology with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. “That tells us the sow is limiting piglet growth rate by not producing enough milk.”\\n\\nMammary lapse\\n\\nAs well, the move towards hyperprolific sows increased litter size without sufficiently boosting the sow’s milk yield, resulting in less milk per piglet than ten years ago.\\n\\n“That’s where I come in, as I want to increase the amount of milk a sow produces. My focus over the past 15 years has been mammary development since the more mammary cells you have, the more milk you can synthesize.”\\n\\nTiming is everything\\n\\nThe two key periods for mammary development are from 3 months to puberty and the last third of gestation. While Dr. Farmer has studied a number of factors affecting that development, her focus for this project was sow body condition.\\n\\n“It has been shown that if a sow at the end of gestation has 36 mm of backfat, she will produce less milk than a sow with 25 mm of backfat. But that information is useless for producers as nobody has animals that obese.”\\n\\nConsequently, there was really no helpful advice for producers regarding body condition and milk production until this study.\\n\\nBring backfat to the forefront\\n\\n“To make the research more relevant, I looked at sows that better represent what you see on-farm. Starting with animals having similar backfat levels at mating, we gave them three different amounts of feed in gestation and compared their mammary development.”\\n\\nThe results were both interesting to producers and surprising for researchers.\\n\\n“I thought 25-26 mm of back fat would have a negative impact on mammary development, but that didn’t happen. It was actually the sows between 12-15 mm that showed poor mammary development, while animals in the 16 -26 mm range were just fine.”\\n\\nFor producers, these results can impact their gilt feeding programs.\\n\\n“When you have a gilt in its first gestation, you must be sure to feed it enough. The current practice is to limit feed intake in that period, but this study shows you must look at body condition and perhaps go slowly on the restriction if necessary. Though a lot of feed companies will give you restrictions based on weight and backfat, they didn’t have exact target numbers until now. Thanks to our findings, nutritionists and producers know that 16 mm is the lower limit for backfat in a Yorkshire x Landrace cross.”\\n\\nMost importantly, industry is now aware that feeding level in gestation is critical to achieve optimal mammary development in late gestation and to maximize future potential milk yield. Armed with that knowledge, producers can refine their feeding programs and help set the sow up for future success.\\n\\n“A few years back, a growing gilt was fed the same way as a growing pig. Yet, the growing pig will get eaten while the growing gilt will have babies that need milk. They shouldn’t be treated the same, and it’s great that nutritionists will have a better idea of how to feed new gilts. It’s just one aspect of production, yet it’s something that industry can take and use right away.”\\n\\nSource : Swine Innovation Porc',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Geoff Geddes, for Swine Innovation Porc\\n\\nWalking on a slatted floor all day with cloven hooves might sound easy enough…until you try it. Navigating the gaps in concrete flooring can be treacherous for pigs, while dealing with knowledge gaps on proper slat width is a challenge for producers. Filling that information void is a priority, especially in light of the revised Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Pigs. And if it matters to industry, it matters to researchers.\\n\\n“Flooring is one of the big topics these days as it’s associated with a number of foot and leg problems for sows,” said Dr. Laurie Connor, Professor, Department of Animal Science in the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences at the University of Manitoba. “Lameness is the second most common reason for culling, and it’s an even greater issue in group housing where animals must move around a lot to get feed, access certain resources and maintain their position in the social hierarchy.”\\n\\nThe wrong flooring configuration can cause problems with lying and walking comfort, hoof injuries, and resulting distress and pain. Because that can lead to sub-optimal performance, it’s also a pain in the producer’s pocketbook, which makes the lack of well-validated guidelines for slat and gap width especially troubling.\\n\\nSeeking concrete results\\n\\n“We know slatted floors are problematic, but they’re needed for manure removal. Given that reality, our objective for this project was to determine the most effective slat and gap widths for concrete flooring in group housing that would balance sow comfort, manure management and general air quality.”\\n\\nUsing video and kinematics (the branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects), researchers tested the way 12 young, non-lame sows and 12 larger, lame sows walked on three different slat and gap widths.\\n\\n“We found that a slat width of 105 mm (about 4 inches) and a gap width of 19 mm (.75 inches) had the least impact on the animals’ normal gait or movement, especially in the smaller sows.”\\n\\nThen it was time to test those results in the barn using two sets of young, pregnant gilts during two gestations. One group was housed on the widths mentioned above, while the control group used slats of 125 mm and gaps of 25 mm, which are common dimensions in the industry.\\n\\nGait keepers\\n\\n“We did a lot of detailed observations including gait scores at the beginning, middle and end of pregnancy. We compared the condition of the feet when they went in, and at the end when they came off the flooring, and also looked at weight distribution on each limb at these two points. Combining all of this information gave us a good idea of what was going on.”\\n\\nThey also looked at a number of other factors including body weight and back fat changes, reproductive performance, air quality and cleanliness of the pens. In an industry that’s always pushing for larger litters and heavier pigs, researchers concluded that when it comes to slats and gaps, “less is more”.\\n\\n“Pigs on the narrower slats and gaps appeared to be more comfortable and had fewer feet sole lesions and wall cracks. There was no difference in air quality or cleanliness between the two groups, and the slightly narrower slats may actually increase the chance of manure going through, so that’s a bonus.”\\n\\nGoing forward, Dr. Connor said this doesn’t offer enough evidence for people to “rip up floors and put in new ones”; however, it does suggest that those doing conversions or new builds would be wise to opt for the narrower slats and gaps.\\n\\nIt means a change in thinking for producers, but it could be a change for the better. And, who knows, they might just be floored by the results.\\n\\nSource : University of Manitoba',\n",

Japan closed to U.S. lamb in December 2003 as a result of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) detected in the U.S. cattle herd.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Japan was a primary market for U.S. lamb before losing access, so obviously our lamb producers and the lamb industry are very excited about this opportunity to again export our quality products to an upscale market,” said U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) Chair Dennis Stiffler, president of the Texas division of Halperns’ Purveyors of Steak and Seafood and former chief executive officer of Mountain States Rosen, a livestock producer-owned processor and distributor of lamb and veal products. “The Japanese have proven in the past that they are very receptive to the unique flavor of U.S. lamb, and 95 percent of all lamb raised in the U.S. is grain-fed. It’s a very succulent protein that will stand up well to competitors’ products in the Japanese market. U.S. lamb has been well-received in other upscale markets, including Taiwan which reopened to U.S. lamb in 2016. But Japan presents an exceptional opportunity for significant export growth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAlready the leading value market for U.S. beef and pork, Japanese consumers are expected to embrace U.S. lamb’s flavor and consistency, along with the essential nutrients that make it part of a healthy diet.\\n\\n\\n\\nDan Halstrom, USMEF president and CEO, thanked U.S. agricultural and trade officials for their efforts to restore market access for U.S. lamb and said the announcement lays the groundwork for a much-needed boost for lamb exports.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As is the case in other markets where U.S. red meat has been successful in regaining access, this is the result of tremendous work by U.S. government officials and the U.S. meat industry,” said Halstrom. “There is great demand for high-quality, grain-fed red meat in Japan, as demonstrated by the success of U.S. beef and pork. The U.S. lamb industry is anxious to capitalize on opportunities in Japan’s restaurant and retail sectors, and USMEF is eager to begin promoting U.S. lamb in Japan.”\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nevin Lawrence\\n\\nA review of multiple studies conducted on weed management in dry beans in the US and Canada indicated that without weed control, yield losses could be as much as $720 million per year.\\n\\nIf you are a farmer, the idea of purposively not controlling weeds might seem like a silly proposition, but the question has been asked before. A few years ago, a county in a neighboring state was debating banning the use of genetically engineered crops on county-owned land. Several farmers leasing county-owned land risked being prohibited from using glyphosate for weed control in their sugarbeet crop. During the public discussion, a concerned citizen asked if any of the farmers had tried not controlling their weeds. Maybe, this person advanced, maybe weeds would just go away on their own if we just stopped trying to control them. While I do not believe there has been a study on whether weeds will decide to just go away, we do have a fairly good idea of what happens when a weed control strategy is “do nothing.”\\n\\nWeed scientists generally want a weed control program to provide 95% control of weeds for it to be considered a good program. To determine the level of weed control a program provides, each weed control trial needs to include a “non-treated check” treatment. In the “non-treated check” plots, the crop is planted and no weed control measures are taken. You may have seen those plots before. They stick out in a field as wild, messy, 6-feet-tall weed jungles in perfect rectangles of 10-by-30 feet. We include this treatment to have a good idea of how many weeds are present in the study and what the value of the other weed control treatments are in controlling weeds and preserving yield. Essentially, the non-treated check serves as a baseline to evaluate weed control programs. So what happens when we do nothing to control weeds?\\n\\nWith the data from that paper we can imagine what would happen if we waited for the weeds to leave on their own. If we stopped controlling weeds in dry bean, the average yield loss for all of North America would be 71%, or a loss of 28 million CWT. Financially, this would translate to a $720 million loss (per year) for the US and Canada. Yield loss would not be equally distributed across North America, however. Some regions would be more impacted than others. Michigan reported an average potential yield loss of “only” 31% over the past 10 years, while North Dakota averaged a staggering 93% yield loss. Nebraska was in the midrange of this disastrous scenario, with an average potential yield loss of 58%. The potential monetary loss for Nebraska from not controlling weeds is estimated at $55 million (per year).\\n\\nWhile the results of this paper are not surprising, it is good to have science-based data on the value of weed control. Let’s use it to support the efforts of farmers, researchers, and other ag professionals as they battle weeds and a sometimes-misguided public opinion.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCereals\\n\\nWinter wheat harvest progress is around 7-10 days ahead of last year. Given the relatively dry summer, early reports of yield have been average to below average although crop quality has been respectable.\\n\\nPost-harvest weed management\\n\\nA significant amount of annual weed seeds can be produced and dispersed after wheat harvest if the ground is left fallow. In some years, annual weed seed can mature in as little as 4 weeks after harvest. Planting a cover crop (i.e. oats) after wheat harvest can do a nice job at minimizing the amount of annual weeds going to seed and then allows an opportunity in the fall to terminate the cover crop and deal with perennial weeds at the same time. If it is not desirable to plant a cover crop, shallow tillage can also reduce the amount of weeds setting seed and will allow the perennial weeds to re-grow so that they can be managed in the fall.\\n\\nIf red clover was inter-seeded into the wheat crop there are a couple of ways that you can knock back annual weed growth so that you can let the clover grow as much as possible and maximize its nitrogen credit. The tried and true method, but most labour intensive, is to “clip” or trim the top of the red clover which will ‘chop off’ the weed seed heads at the same time. More recently OMAFRA and the University of Guelph have experimented with the application of MCPA as a way to manage broadleaf weeds in a red clover cover crop. There are three key learnings from this work:\\n\\nThe ester formulation of MCPA (Figure 1) causes significantly less plant damage then the amine formulation (Figure 2) Red clover biomass is initially stunted during the first week after application but does recover within 2-3 weeks. Targeting broadleaf weeds when they are smaller will result in better control, if annual grassy weeds are predominant then the application of MCPA Ester will be insufficient and clipping is a better option to minimize weed seed dispersal.\\n\\nFigure 1: Red clover at 7 days after an application of MCPA Ester (left) compared to an un-treated strip. Note the curling of the leaves giving a slightly grey appearance\\n\\nFigure 2: Red clover at 7 days after an application of MCPA Amine (left) compared to an un-treated strip. The amine formulation has consistently provided greater foliar burn then the ester formulation.\\n\\nCorn\\n\\nFigure 3: Newly hatched western bean cutworms (1st instars) from an egg mass.\\n\\nWestern bean cutworm moth trap counts have been very low so far compared to previous years. An interactive map of trapping numbers can be found at www.cornpest.ca. Many corn fields have begun tasseling and may avoid much of the risk though it is still important to scout for egg masses now (Figure 3). The action threshold for WBC is a cumulative total of 5% of plants with an egg mass within a three week period of before, during and after peak flight for your region. The optimal timing for spraying insecticides for WBC control is during fresh silk stage, which ensures that you are protecting the ear from all of the larvae that have hatched on the plant. Download the pestmanager app ( www.pestmanager.ca ) to have access to management options for this pest.\\n\\nSoybeans\\n\\nAlthough some areas in the province have had seen soybean aphids populations at the action threshold and have sprayed, much of the province has aphid populations below the action threshold. Regular scouting should be done from now until the R6 (full seed) stage of soybean to minimize any yield loss with this pest. The aphid advisor app, which can be downloaded at www.aphidapp.com is a new tool that helps assess whether or not control of soybean aphids is warranted and also indicates other fields’ results by county across the province. The action threshold is 250 aphids per plant on 80% of the plants and is actively increasing when the crop is in the R1 stage until end of R5 stage.\\n\\nEdible beans\\n\\nMonitor two traps per field to determine WBC presence in your area. Scouting adjacent corn fields is encouraged since WBC is extremely difficult to find in beans before the damage is done. If the adjacent corn field has reached threshold and the two traps at the dry bean field have accumulated at least 150 moths, it is a good indication that the dry bean field will need to be sprayed once pods are developing on the plants. This is particularly true for larger seeded beans like cranberries that not only result in picks from the feeding damage but also seed discolouration from exposure to oxygen from holes in the pods created by WBC. Try to scout for pod feeding before making a final spray decision but use both the trap counts and adjacent corn field scouting as the key indicators. Refer to the moth trapping maps at www.cornpest.ca to identify areas where moths are actively being trapped.\\n\\nDry Conditions\\n\\nRain was highly variable across the province this week, giving some fields relief while others continue to deal with moisture stress. Information on the implications and help with making cropping decisions in dry conditions can be found at OMAFRA adverse weather webpage provided in the link below.\\n\\nhttp://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/weather/adverseweather.html#dry\\n\\nSource : fieldcropnews',\n",

That isn’t the case this time, Kunkel said.\\n\\n“Usually we’re reactive and not proactive,” he said. “In this case (the co-op) is being proactive in addressing grain storage issues before every other bin is filled.”\\n\\nIn addition to the grain tower construction, the 4,000-member co-op is hiring more staff to support farmers.\\n\\nThe co-op “hired two new crop specialists as salespeople and to work with the farmers who produce the crops,” Kunkel said. “The growth here isn’t rapid but there is an increasing need in this area for people to work in ag.”\\n\\nCo-opérative Régionale de Nipissing Sudbury photo',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe AxioBib2 can operate as low as 6 psi\\n\\nBy Diego Flammini\\n\\nStaff Writer\\n\\nFarms.com\\n\\nA leading tire manufacturer introduced a new line designed for modern agricultural equipment.\\n\\nAttendees at Ag in Motion in Saskatoon, Sask. received their first look at Michelin’s new AxioBib2 tires yesterday.\\n\\nThey are high-traction capacity radial VF (very high flexion) tires for mid- and high-powered tractors.\\n\\nThe AxioBib2 is also CTIS (central tire inflation system) ready. Farmers can use CTIS to control tire pressures from their tractor cabs.\\n\\nThe CTIS capabilities allow the tires to operate at low pressure rates, which have added benefits, said David Graden, agriculture operational marketing manager for Michelin.\\n\\n“The tires have exceptional field traction and performance,” he told Farms.com today. “They can run as low as 9 psi in singles and 6 psi at field operating speeds in duals.”\\n\\nAside from traction benefits, operating at the AxioBib2 tires at low psi levels may also help growers increase yields, Graden said.\\n\\n“The University of Illinois did a study on soil compaction and impact on yield,” he said. “Researchers have seen about a 4.3 percent yield gain in corn by using Michelin tires.”\\n\\nProducers should take a practical approach to selecting tires.\\n\\nMuch like purchasing a car, testing the tires before buying them will give farmers an idea of how the tires handle and if they will be a worthwhile investment.\\n\\n“Farmers are getting hit with everything at every angle,” Graden said. “Go drive on the tire, tell us what you think and how you feel about it. It’s the best way to know if the tire is right for your equipment or your farm.”\\n\\nThe AxioBib2 is available in 710/60R42 and 600/60R30 sizes. More sizes will be available in 2019.\\n\\nMichelin also introduced its CrossGrip radial tire for road, grass and snowy conditions.\\n\\nThe tire is designed for loaders, backhoes, telehandlers and tractors. It has 196 tread blocks per wheel rotation and an optimized tread depth to reduce damage during the growing season.\\n\\nFarmers can purchase the CrossGrip as of Aug. 1. The tires are available in 250/80R16, 400/80R24, 440/80R24 and 440/80R28 sizes.\\n\\nMichelin photo',\n",

While in the province, Minister MacAulay also announced a $12.7 million investment for the Canadian swine sector.\\n\\nNext, the minister visited New Brunswick to provide the Canadian Forage and Grasslands Association with funding to undergo projects to increase the sector’s export capacity.\\n\\nIn early July, the minister visited Ontario to provide funding to the poultry , ginseng and wine sectors. On behalf of Minister MacAulay, Neil Ellis, the Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte, also announced investments for the Grain Farmers of Ontario and Soy Canada.\\n\\nAs he ventured into Western Canada, Minister MacAulay participated in a pancake breakfast at the Calgary Stampede before announcing an investment of up to $14 million to support the Canadian beef industry.\\n\\nBefore ending the tour in B.C., the minister provided the Western Grains Research Foundation in Saskatchewan with up to $6.3 million for agronomy research.\\n\\nThese investments will help drive economic growth across the country.\\n\\n“As we all know, farmers are the backbone of our communities and our economy. And agriculture, of course, is part of our future,” MacAulay said. “Our government recognizes agriculture as a core economic sector that will be part of Canada’s path to prosperity.”\\n\\nDuring the press conference, Minister MacAulay discussed some of the concerns he heard from Canadian farmers on his journey.\\n\\nWhen asked about the country’s Temporary Foreign Worker Program, the ag minister referenced his experiences growing potatoes in Prince Edward Island.\\n\\n“I’m aware of the value of making sure you have workers,” he said. “We need to make sure we improve this process. And we will.”\\n\\nIndustry members also worry about the state of trade.\\n\\n“We do not like tariffs by any means, but we have to live with the cards we’re dealt – and we are,” he said. “We’re very supportive of the approach … the government of Canada (is taking).”\\n\\nDespite recently imposed tariffs, the minister seemed optimistic about the future.\\n\\nThe country will be able to attain its goal of exporting $75-billion worth of agri-food products by 2025, MacAulay said.\\n\\n“When you look at the ratification of CETA and CPTPP in the house – and of course, we’re continually dealing with other countries around the world – we will reach and pass that target.”\\n\\nProvincial, territorial and federal ag ministers will continue to discuss these issues this week, Minister MacAulay said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Belomlinsky/Digital Vision Vectors/Getty Images photo',\n",

This seeds of this biennial crop are used for flavouring and contain essential oils. The crop is part of Canada’s spice market, which is worth $5 to $10 million annually.\\n\\nSaskatchewan farmers planted about 5,000 acres of caraway in 2016, the province’s ag ministry says.\\n\\nSome of those caraway acres belong to Shane Stokke, who dedicated about 200 acres of his 2,500-acre farm near Watrous, Sask. to the crop in 2015. In previous years, he planted nearly 600 acres of the crop.\\n\\nHe also produces flax, coriander and canola.\\n\\nHarvest is only a few weeks away and the caraway crop is performing well, he said.\\n\\n“The crop looks really good,” he told Farms.com today. “We had really good seed set and there’s no disease or weeds in the field right now, so I’m excited to harvest the crop.\\n\\n“After I swath it, I let it lay for about a week before I combine it. By the middle of August, harvest should be complete.”\\n\\nOnce the caraway is harvested, farmers have some favourable marketing opportunities.\\n\\nGrowers can earn about $2,200 per tonne, the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation says.\\n\\nBut farmers must be willing to practice patience in order to see good returns, Stokke said.\\n\\n“Caraway isn’t as fluid as other crops in terms of its marketing,” he said. “You’ll more than likely have to wait for a buyer to want the crop, meaning you’ll need to hold onto it for a while.”\\n\\ntm_zml/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

This approach doesn’t calculate how much food was consumed, but rather how much was available to eat.\\n\\nIndeed, changes in food availability depict changes in consumption patterns.\\n\\nPotatoes were the largest source of carbohydrates until the mid 2000s, when wheat flour consumption surged upwards. There is now about the same amount of either source available, the article said.\\n\\n“It shows how much the Canadian meal has changed,” Malek Batal, a professor of public nutrition at the University of Montreal, said in the article.\\n\\n“A typical meal was meat and potatoes. With the changing cultural makeup of Canada, this might have evolved to pasta.”\\n\\nThe consumption of beef has declined over the years.\\n\\nThe peak years for beef were during the 1970s with nearly 37 kilograms available per person. This value is now close to half of that, the article said.\\n\\nChicken is the most popular protein source today, with 25 kilograms of chicken and turkey meat per Canadian.\\n\\nIn terms of fruit, bananas are the most abundant in Canada. Two decades ago, the banana overtook the domestic apple, the article said.\\n\\n“It’s a perfect produce,” Sylvain Charlebois, dean of the faculty of management at Dalhousie University in Halifax and professor, said in the article.\\n\\n“It has a natural envelope, so food safety is never an issue. It’s portable and you can eat it quickly.”\\n\\nA food group that has seen little change is vegetables. Such produce as tomatoes, carrots, lettuce and onions have been in consistent availability for the last 50 years.\\n\\nCoffee has taken the top spot as the most plentiful fluid in Canada, bumping beer to a distant second, the article said. The popularity of Tim Hortons, Starbucks and Second Cup are to thank for this trend.\\n\\nThe availability of wine in Canada is growing though. A decade ago it overtook orange juice in litres available per Canadian, the article said. And it is because Canada is making better wine.\\n\\n“There’s a lot of research now to make sure (the) grape industry is well supported,” Charlebois said.\\n\\n“Our vineyards (are) becoming more efficient.”\\n\\nFor dairy products, almond and soy milk have taken a bite out of milk’s former share, the article said. Statistics Canada doesn’t have Canadian data for these beverages. But in the U.S., between 2011 and 2014, almond milk sales grew by 250 per cent and cow’s milk fell by seven per cent.\\n\\n“The biggest dietary fads in the last 10 years have been two things: dairy and gluten, with people saying we’re not cows, that we’re not supposed to be drinking milk,” Batal said in the article.\\n\\nHowever, the popularity of milk by-products is on the rise. So, more cheese, cream and yogurt.\\n\\nThe Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a five-year, $3 billion investment by federal, provincial and territorial governments, to strengthen the agriculture and agri-food sector.\\n\\nThe partnership also grows trade, enhances research and innovation, and promotes collaboration to support Canadian commodities.',\n",

A dry bin capable of storing 110,000 bushels is also part of the project.\\n\\nIn addition, the upgrades include an elevator leg capable of moving about 250 tonnes of grain per hour.\\n\\nThe entire project will increase capacity at the elevator by about 170,000 bushels.\\n\\nThe improvements reflect the advocacy efforts of farmers in the region, said Brandon Tuinema, agricultural manager with the co-op.\\n\\n“Our members have spoken,” he told Farms.com today. “For years, we were just limping by with some of our equipment to get the grain in. Our farmers wanted faster unloading times, so they can get back to the fields, and more storage, so they had more opportunities with their grain merchandising.”\\n\\nThe construction project also shows the viability of ag in northern Ontario.\\n\\nSoybean acres, for example, increased from 9,889 in 2011 to 24,700 in 2016.\\n\\nBetween government investments and producer interest in the region, infrastructure improvements must reflect those needs, Tuinema said.\\n\\n“There’s been excitement as it pertains to agriculture in northern Ontario,” he said. “There’s been investments in land clearing and tiling to bring more acres into production, so the need is there.\\n\\n“There are more and more crops being grown, and we’re kind of the last frontier of arable land in Ontario. I would expect to see some big advancements in other parts of northern Ontario and those customers will need better service.”\\n\\nFarms.com has reached out to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture for comment.\\n\\nCo-opérative Régionale de Nipissing Sudbury photo',\n",

However, operators of farm equipment must abide by different rules of the road than regular traffic.\\n\\nThe Highway Traffic Act requires slow-moving vehicle (SMV) signs on all vehicles that cannot reach speeds above 40 km/h. Vehicles that bear these signs are subject to a unique speed limit of 40 km/h while operating on a roadway.\\n\\nThe provincial government grouped tractors in this category.\\n\\nSo, operators must display SMV signs on their tractors and self-propelled farm machinery, even if their equipment is capable of travelling at a higher speed, Bob Nichols, senior media liaison officer with the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) told Farms.com today.\\n\\nPeople must place these signs on their equipment at a distance between 0.5 to 2 metres above the road, the Highway Traffic Act states. Other drivers must be able to see the symbol from at least 150 metres away.\\n\\nTractor drivers must also abide by this speed limit, even if they travel in zones with higher limits posted. Otherwise, these individuals could face penalties.\\n\\n“A fine between $60 and $1,000 may be imposed under the Highway Traffic Act if the tractor is travelling greater than 40 km/h,” Nichols said.\\n\\nFor more information on operating farm equipment on roadways, check out this guide from the MTO and this fact sheet from the OFA.\\n\\nCTV News photo',\n",

However, in an effort to put more emphasis on education, the organization redesigned the program two years ago.\\n\\nThe new design includes a self-assessment which contains three modules. These sections cover such topics as fertility, stand maintenance, harvest plans, storage and silo safety.\\n\\nWhile the assessment contains 45 questions, producers only need to fill out the ones that are relevant to their operations, Graham said.\\n\\nOnce participants complete the assessment, they must submit recent soil and feed analyses to the OSCIA office in Guelph.\\n\\n“If you don’t have lab reports for the current crop, send one in from last year,” Graham said.\\n\\nIn each of the eleven OSCIA regions, the three producers with the highest scores will receive gift certificates for seed from the General Seed Company. The first-place growers in each region will also participate in a speaking contest during the organization’s annual conference in February.\\n\\nThen, delegates will vote for this year’s Provincial Forage Master Champion.

I’ve heard countless complaints from owners stating that they wouldn’t be able to run their farms without foreign temporary workers.”\\n\\nHer observation appears to be correct.\\n\\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the agriculture industry employed around 314,000 back in 2013. This number has since dropped by 11 per cent to 279,500 in 2017.\\n\\nWith such a decline in workers, how can farm owners receive the help they need?\\n\\n“In recent years, farmers have been hiring foreign temporary workers to make up for not only the lack of employees, but also to lower the industry’s high turnover rate.\\n\\n“These workers are much more committed to their jobs. A lot of them are here to better their lives and most of them have a very good work ethic.”\\n\\nSimms added, “they’re here to improve themselves and their families. They view this employment as an opportunity, whether it’s short or long-term, it’s an opportunity for them to move forward in the world.”\\n\\nThis is a growing concern for Canadian farmers as they not only can’t find workers, but when they do, most only last a few short months.\\n\\nSo, how can farmers start the process of hiring foreign temporary workers?\\n\\n“Farmers should put postings on job banks, the internet, ethnic papers, and farmer magazines. Word-of-mouth is always a good thing; once a foreign temporary worker is hired, the employer will start to build a good reputation in that foreign area,” explained Simms.\\n\\nWith the shortage of workers across the province, it’s important for farmers to explore all their options.\\n\\n“We are here not only to help Canadian farmers, but to also provide the necessary legal assistance for these foreign temporary workers.\\n\\n“We are proficient at this service, but unfortunately it’s underrepresented. We have the resources to help our Canadian farmers and we want to fill this niche,” Simms elaborated.\\n\\nFor more information about Judy Simms Paralegal’s services, visit judisimmsparalegal.ca or call 905-737-9747.',\n",

The pair discussed the initiatives that companies and the government undertake to address mental health challenges in agriculture.\\n\\nBoth witnesses touched on the unique nature of the industry.\\n\\n“We know that farming can be unpredictable when the difference between profit and financial loss for producers often depends on several factors, some well beyond their control,” Hoffort told the committee. “The reality is that things don’t always go as planned. (This) can have serious impacts on farmers’ operations, and perhaps even their emotional and mental wellbeing.”\\n\\nThe speakers discussed some of the programs that FCC and the Government of Canada offer to help farmers manage the stress related to this volatility.\\n\\nFor example, FCC has an Ag Crisis Fund, which provides financial support to producers who face disasters, including floods, tornados, barn and house fires, deaths of family members, and farm accidents, Hoffort said.\\n\\n“Last year, we reached out to 287 customers impacted by crisis,” he said. “Two of those cases involved suicides. This year, that number has risen to eight cases so far.\\n\\nAAFC has worked to tackle these issues through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.\\n\\n“Provinces can use the financial aid provided by these programs to directly support mental health initiatives in the industry,” Rosser said.\\n\\nProducers can also utilize business risk management programs to “manage major risks that threaten the viability of their farms,” he told the committee.\\n\\nEven though healthcare falls under provincial jurisdiction, the federal government has taken action, too.\\n\\n“In Budget 2017, the government earmarked $5 billion over ten years for the provinces and territories (to) improve access to mental health and addiction services,” Rosser said.\\n\\nDespite its ongoing efforts, the industry needs to do more for farm families facing mental health challenges, both experts noted.\\n\\n“Farmers, ranchers and producers are the backbone of the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector,” Rosser said. “We all need to work together to take further action on this important issue by improving awareness, reducing risk factors, improving access to quality mental health services and eliminating the stigma often associated with mental illness.”\\n\\nDuring the question period, attendees discussed such topics as mental health counseling, research and the opioid crisis.\\n\\nThe committee also talked about how other professions have handled the topic of mental health.\\n\\nFor example, first responders and members of the military, who previously faced challenges around mental health, now openly talk about issues like post-traumatic stress disorder, Allstair Macgregor, an MP from British Columbia, said.\\n\\n“People are encouraged to seek help,” he said.\\n\\nThe ag industry could look to the Department of National Defence and Public Safety Canada to learn how they assisted people in these professions. But, of course, some key differences exist between the military, first responders, and the ag industry.\\n\\n“I think one main difference is that those environments depend on teams (and) colleagues need to have the full support of each other, whereas farmers are often out by themselves,” Macgregor said.\\n\\nTo talk with a professional from Crisis Services Canada, call 1-833-456-4566 (or 1-866-277-3553 for Quebec residents) or text 45645. You can also chat online .\\n\\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, please call 911 immediately.\\n\\nPointImages/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

However, the actual conversion cost typically sat in the range of $300 to $500 – although producers can find ways to bring these expenses down even further.\\n\\nFor example, Ferme Pic Rouge, a swine operation in Quebec, paid $58 per sow place to convert its farrow-to-finish facility into two barns in 2010, Dr. Jennifer Brown, a research scientist at the Prairie Swine Centre, told Farms.com yesterday.\\n\\nThe renovations included a new feeding system, drop feeders and bowl drinkers, she said. The operation’s capacity also increased from 480 to 600 sows. Farm staff completed the labour.\\n\\nLes Elevages St. Felix in Quebec also transitioned to group sow housing in 2013. Producers renovated the 250-sow farrow-to-finish operation into a 625-sow farrowing barn for a cost of $30 per sow place, Brown said. As with the previous example, the producers provided the labour for the conversion.\\n\\nThis decrease in cost is likely due to many operators completing the labour on their own, rather than hiring contractors, she said.\\n\\nThe type of feeding systems and amount of work required can also play a role, she added.\\n\\n“These floor-feeding examples are the cheapest option,” Brown said. “In both cases, partially slatted finisher barns were converted to group gestation.”\\n\\nFor more information on the cost of barn conversions, visit the National Sow Housing Conversion Project website .\\n\\nNational Pork Board/Pork Checkoff photo',\n",

Many fields in southwestern Ontario are currently approaching this point.\\n\\nScouts can identify adult beetles by their metallic blue-green wings, and reddish-orange heads and legs, Baute said in her article.

Reforestation of land suitable for farmland makes little sense unless it is done to create buffers,” one Canadian stakeholder said.\\n\\nUPDATED MAY 23, 2018\\n\\nPamWalker68 / iStock / Getty Images Plus photo',\n",

Many of the live goats, however, were imported.\\n\\nAn increased Japanese market share means farmers will be challenged to meet the demands, said Anita Teel Dahnke, executive director of the American Goat Federation.\\n\\n“Anything that increases marketing possibilities is a good thing for producers,” she told Farms.com today. “But we have to keep in mind that U.S. goat producers can’t meet the demand for goats in (our) country.\\n\\n“We import a large portion of the goat eaten here, so we have a long way to go increase production to meet the needs of other markets.”\\n\\nSheep and lamb industry representatives are also optimistic about the potential trade opportunities.\\n\\nThe U.S. exported $US$19.5 million worth of lamb last year, the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) says.\\n\\nJapan imported about $168 million of lamb last year, mostly from Australia and New Zealand.\\n\\nThe renewed access for U.S. lamb can only help the national export figures increase, said Dan Halstrom, president and CEO of USMEF.\\n\\n“There is great demand for high-quality grain-fed red meat in Japan, as demonstrated by the success of U.S. beef and pork,” he said in a statement yesterday. “The U.S. lamb industry is anxious to capitalize on opportunities in Japan’s restaurant and retail sectors.”\\n\\nStudioimagen73/iStock/Getty Images Plus',\n",

All 28 EU nations must sign off on the agreement before it can come into effect.\\n\\nItaly has 292 food products that fall under a Protected Designation of Origin (P.D.O) or Protected Geographical Indication (P.G.I.) designation. These labels help guarantee the products are made with distinct characteristics that are native to the region or production process.\\n\\nCanada recognized more than 40 of those products under CETA, but that number is not enough to warrant ratifying the trade agreement, said Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s deputy prime minister.\\n\\n“Soon CETA will arrive in parliament and this majority will reject it and will not ratify it,” he told Coldiretti, an Italian farm organization that supports the government’s position, Reuters reports today.\\n\\nItalian officials and organizations have discussed rejecting CETA for at least the last month.\\n\\n“We will not ratify the free-trade treaty with Canada because it protects only a small part of our (P.D.O) and (P.G.I.) products,” Italy’s ag minister, Gian Marco Centinaio, told local newspaper La Stampa on June 14, Reuters reported .\\n\\nColdiretti called the trade agreement “wrong and risky” in a June statement, and estimated food exports could triple if food counterfeiting is taken seriously.\\n\\nBut Canadian negotiators remain confident Italy will agree on CETA’s terms.\\n\\n“I’m confident we will have full ratification in the end, and the important thing is this agreement has entered into force as an economic matter,” Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, told reporters in June.\\n\\nNine European countries, including Spain, Denmark and Croatia, have already ratified CETA.',\n",

These Capitol Hill meetings focused on:\\n\\nThe necessity for a conclusion to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations and an end to the imposed trade tariffs on corn and corn products\\n\\nSupport of a fully funded 2018 Farm Bill that will meet farmers priorities with crop insurance and increased funding for the for critical trade promotion and export programs (MAP and FMD)\\n\\nExpanding consumer access to higher blends of ethanol by allowing for year-round E15 use and reallocate the gallons lost due to small refinery exemptions\\n\\n“Trade was a key topic of Corn Congress and it was a key message we took to Capitol Hill,” said Iowa Corn Growers Association (ICGA) President Mark Recker, a farmer from Arlington. “We need to find a path forward on trade before we see long-term impacts to farmers and rural America. We are counting on the administration and Congress to reach a resolution on responsible trade policies including seeing NAFTA negotiations through and solidify our relationships with Mexico and Canada.”\\n\\nRecker also joined other ICGA farmer-leaders in meetings with the Iowa Delegation including Senator Ernst and Senator Grassley where they discussed the need of working with EPA Administrator Wheeler to maintain a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). “We need year-round E15, so we can expand our use of higher blends of ethanol and we urge the EPA to reallocate the gallons of ethanol already lost due to the small refinery exemptions.

This comes on the heels of recent waivers granted by EPA to refiners who have failed to comply with the law of the land-the Renewable Fuel Standard-requiring the petroleum industry to include a modest percentage of fuels derived from renewable resources.\\n\\nA previously established market of at least 15 billion gallons has been whittled down by 2 billion gallons, effectively reducing corn demand by nearly 700 million bushels. With many of our farmers already operating below the cost of production, this is another blow. It also comes at a time when EPA is grappling with federal fuel economy standards and the need for high-octane, low-carbon fuels-a job description ethanol fills perfectly when used in higher blends. The Department of Energy has long endorsed the use of blends between 25 and 40 percent as the sweet spot for ethanol in terms of price, octane and emissions. Here in South Dakota, a joint effort by corn growers and ethanol producers continues to demonstrate E30 blends in conventional vehicles with tremendous success and no problems whatsoever. And that is important because, in another ironic twist to this story, FFVs have been put out to pasture thanks to EPA. Automaker incentives to produce such vehicles have been all but eliminated and the fact is, the higher blends are more efficient in conventional vehicles.\\n\\nEPA has all the legal authority it needs to extend the vapor pressure rules to allow year-round use of E15 and higher blends, but has not included such a rule or even proposed to do so. Nor has it approved an E30 certified fuel by which auto manufacturers can vigorously test new models to enable them to optimize and provide warrantees. Yet, EPA has the time and resources to pull out an Obama Administration proposed rule that the Trump Administration should throw away.\\n\\nThe rule proposed by EPA is called Renewable Enhancement and Growth Support and is the answer to a question no one in the ethanol industry asked. But one does not need to be a master detective to conclude who would ask for such an action: the petroleum industry. Is there any precedent for an industry to have a federal agency cap its competition? It is so outrageous it is hard to really grasp.\\n\\nNot only does such an action cap the volume of ethanol but it relegates it to its lowest value. Its highest value is to provide octane and reduce the toxic carcinogens in gasoline while offering consumers a significant cost savings at the pump. Left unchallenged, the oil industry would have a guaranteed 85 percent of the motor fuel market for light-duty vehicles. The 15 percent share left for ethanol would be used for octane but the oil industry would continue to make a huge profit off the lower price it pays for that ethanol, all the while continuing to unnecessarily poison the air all Americans breathe.\\n\\nThe ethanol industry, farmers everywhere, environmentalists and health advocates should share a common goal of having this rule scrapped. Proponents of a free market should be appalled at the intervention of a federal agency in the market. Consumers should be outraged that a lower-cost, healthier fuel is intentionally being denied to them by the very government agency charged to protect them. In fact, anyone other than someone who makes a profit off gasoline should make defeating this rule a high priority.\\n\\nDoug Sombke is President of South Dakota Farmers Union and a fourth-generation Conde farmer.',\n",

We believe EPA should use the Renewable Fuel Standard volume rule to remedy the harm caused by the extensive retroactive exemptions given to refineries over the past year and ensure future exemptions are accounted for. These refinery exemptions decrease ethanol blending and reduce demand and profits for my corn crop. Every gallon of renewable fuel blending waived by EPA reduces the consumer benefits of the RFS.”\\n\\nEPA’s proposal supports some growth in the RFS volumes and continues to propose an implied 15-billion-gallon volume for conventional ethanol. However, the proposed rule allows for retroactive refinery exemptions, without reallocating those waived gallons, undercutting the volume targets and rendering the proposed blending levels meaningless. In the past year, EPA has retroactively waived 2.25 billion ethanol equivalent-gallons from the 2016 and 2017 volumes through 48 refinery exemptions, many of which went to refineries owned by large, profitable companies.\\n\\n“The EPA should end the practice of granting unjustified RFS waivers behind closed doors and uphold the strong biofuel targets promised by President Trump. America's corn growers are ready and able to do our part to increase American energy use and production, and hold down prices at the fuel pump,” said NCGA President and North Dakota farmer Kevin Skunes. “EPA needs to listen to farmers comments, account for the waivers and make the RFS whole.”\\n\\nBecause many corn farmers are in Washington this week for NCGA’s Corn Congress and meetings with Members of Congress and unable to attend the Michigan public hearing, farmer delegates at Corn Congress took the opportunity to submit their comments to EPA online this morning. Farmers across the country can join this effort by visiting www.standupforcorn.com/take-action to “Tell EPA to Restore the RFS.”\",\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow is the time to start thinking about and planning for corn silage harvest. Preparations taken now and close attention to details like moisture content can mean higher-quality silage when you peel back the plastic months from now.\\n\\nOne of the most important factors influencing corn silage quality is moisture content at time of harvest. Ideally, corn silage should be harvested at the moisture content appropriate for the type of silo used. Recommended moisture contents are 65-70 percent for horizontal silos, 63-68 percent for conventional tower silos, 55-60 percent for limited-oxygen silos and 65 percent for silo bags, writes Jud Heinrichs, professor of dairy science and Gregory W. Roth, Ph.D., professor of agronomy, both with Penn State.\\n\\nCrop dry matter yields are maximized near 65 percent moisture (Table 3) and losses during feeding, storage and harvesting are minimized. Delaying harvest can reduce both the fiber and starch digestibility as the stover gets more lignified and the overmature kernels become harder and less digestible if left unbroken after ensiling.\\n\\nTable 3. Corn silage yield and quality as influenced by growth stage.\\n\\nSilage moisture at harvest is not difficult to determine and should be monitored, if possible, to prevent harvesting of the crop outside of the desired moisture range. A commercial forage moisture tester or a microwave oven can be used to determine the moisture content fairly rapidly. If silage moisture is above ideal levels, then harvest should be delayed if possible.\\n\\nCorn that is ensiled extremely wet will ferment poorly and lose nutrients by seepage, which also has potential to damage the silo and if not contained, contaminate local water supplies. Silage that is too dry may result in poorly packed material, causing more mold and spoilage due to air trapped in the silage. In dry, overmature corn silage, the stover portion of the plant is less digestible and contains lower amounts of sugars and vitamin A.\\n\\nMoisture content cannot be determined accurately using the kernel milkline, because of variations due to weather and hybrids. Moisture content should be measured rather than estimated.\\n\\nOne strategy for timing corn silage harvest is to chop a sample at the full dent stage, just as the milkline appears, and determine the moisture content. Then estimate the harvest date by using a typical drydown rate of 0.50 to 0.75 percentage units per day.\\n\\nHarvest considerations should also focus on obtaining the correct particle size distribution and the need to process the crop. Processing silage refers to putting the chopped material between two rollers that are installed in the harvester to crush the harvested material as it passes through. Kernel processing units are becoming more popular on corn silage harvesters in Pennsylvania. Kernel processing has the advantage of crushing cob slices and kernels and can increase the starch availability by about 10 percent in the silage. The current data shows no clear nutritional advantage to processing silage unless it is overly mature with hard kernels. In some cases, this has resulted in increased milk production compared to unprocessed silage. A good general recommendation for the theoretical length of cut for processed silage is 3/4 inch with a 1-2 mm roller clearance.\\n\\nFigure 1. The Penn State Particle Size Separator can be used to monitor silage particle size.\\n\\nFor unprocessed silage, an average theoretical length of cut should range from 3/8 to 3/4 of an inch. Particle size of corn silage should be monitored during harvesting because it can change as crop moisture content varies. The Penn State Particle Size Separator can be used to estimate the particle size distributions for harvested corn silage.\\n\\nTable 4. General recommendations for corn silage particle size distributions on the three sieves and bottom pan in the Penn State Particle Size Separator.\\n\\nOnce harvesting has begun, fill the silo as rapidly as possible and continue until it is filled. Continue to evaluate processed corn throughout the harvest season. Kernels should be broken into multiple pieces and cobs should be broken into thumbnail-sized pieces or less. As the crop matures after half milkline, it may be desirable to have more kernel breakage so that much of the grain is in the bottom pan of the particle size separator.\\n\\nThe most desirable method of packing bunker silos is the progressive wedge method, where silage is continually packed on a 30-40 percent grade. This minimizes the surface area exposed to the air that can result in DM and forage quality losses. If this is not possible, the silos should be packed by spreading relatively thin layers of silage (6 inches deep) and packing it well. If packed well, the density of the silage should be about 14 pounds of dry matter per cubic foot.\\n\\nFigure 2. Technique for ensiling forage in bunker silos.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy John Schoenhals\\n\\nWestern bean cutworm (WBC) adult moth catches in our trapping network are ticking up, with a noticeable increase from the week before. For week ending July 14, 24 counties monitored 88 traps (Figure 1). Overall, there was an average of 14.5 moths per trap (1116 total captured). This is an increase from an average of 3.4 moths/trap (217 total captured) the previous week.\\n\\nFigure 1. Average Western bean cutworm adult per trap in Ohio counties, followed in parentheses by total number of traps monitored in each county for the week ending July 14, 2018. Legend in the bottom left describes the color coding on map for the average WBC per county.\\n\\nLife cycle and feeding. Adult moths (what we monitor in the traps) will be making their way into corn fields where females will lay eggs on the uppermost portion of the flag leaf. Eggs are laid in unevenly distributed clusters of 5–200, but averaging about 50 per cluster, and hatch within 5–7 days (Figure 2). Eggs first appear white, then tan and then a dark purple. Once eggs turn purple, they will hatch within 24 to 48 hours (Figure 3). In pre-tassel corn, caterpillars will move to the whorl to feed on the flag leaf and unemerged tassel. Once the tassel emerges, larvae then move to the ear, while feeding on corn pollen, leaf tissue, and silks. Later they will enter the ear through the tip, or by chewing through the side of the husk. Damage occurs from both direct feeding and from mold problems at feeding sites.\\n\\nFigure 2. WBC egg mass.\\n\\nScouting and management. You can view our scouting video here. Female moths prefer to lay eggs in pre-tassel corn approaching tassel, so check such fields first. To scout for eggs or larvae, choose at least 20 consecutive plants in 5 random locations and inspect the uppermost 3–4 leaves for eggs, as well as the silks for larvae if tassel has emerged. Be sure to inspect different areas of the field that may be in different growth stages. For field corn, if 8% or more of the plants inspected have eggs or larvae, consider treatment. For sweet corn, consider treatment if eggs or larvae are found on >4% of plants for the processing market or on >1% of plants for fresh-market. Bt corn with the Cry1F trait can no longer be relied upon for good western bean cutworm control, so these fields should be scouted too. These include Herculex I, Herculex Xtra, SmartStax, and others.\\n\\nIf infestations exceed threshold, many insecticides are available to adequately control western bean cutworm, especially those containing a pyrethroid. However, as with any ear-burrowing caterpillar pest, timing is critical. Insecticide applications must occur after egg hatch, or after tassel emergence, but before caterpillars enter the ear. If eggs have hatched, applications should be made after 95% of the field has tassel. If eggs have not hatched, monitor for the color change. Hatch will occur within 24–48 hours once eggs turn purple. To search for larval injury after it has occurred, search the corn for ears having feeding holes on the outside of the husks.\\n\\nFigure 3. WBC larvae hatching from egg mass.

The summer generation can be cryptic. Corn is tall and unless you are actively scouting populations can “magically appear”. Wheat is not out of the woods until combined and oats could be an excellent habitat for the summer generation. Throw pastures on the list as well.\\n\\nBased on your location in Wisconsin, you may be at the tail end of the spring generation or starting the summer generation now. Infested fields are hard to predict so spot checking all field is a good idea especially if you have grassy weeds that have escaped control.\\n\\nArmyworm larvae have tan heads with a net-like pattern of lines, yellow belly, faint orange stripes on sides and darker striping on back. The intensity of striping can vary from those which are faint to those which are so dark colored that lines are not easily visible. Base your identification by looking at several individuals.\\n\\nEconomic thresholds and guidelines for corn is to treat when either 75% of the plants have one armyworm/plant or 25% of the plants have two or more larvae AND the larvae are 1 inch or less in length. Treating in small grains is suggested if there are 3 or more armyworm/sq ft. But be careful of head clipping.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Bryan Jensen\\n\\nThe next 2-3 weeks will be a good time to start spot-check continuous corn fields for corn rootworm feeding injury. Peak damage will usually occur by late July. Waiting longer increases the risk of regenerated roots masking injury.\\n\\nMid to late July in Wisconsin is the time you can validate your corn rootworm management decisions by checking for root damage. This is the time period just after feeding damage would have occurred, and just before regrowth would start to mask the damage.\\n\\nSome growers have elected to change their rootworm control practices because of low corn prices and very low beetle populations. Digging and rating roots for injury during this time period can confirm efficacy and hopefully relieving anxiety questioning if the made the correct choice. Evaluating roots will also give you a heads up on any Bt resistance problems you may have.\\n\\nDig a 6-7 inch ball of roots and pressure wash all the soil off to expose damage. To quantify root damage use the Nodal Injury Scale developed by J. Oleson, Y. Park, T. Nowatzki and J. Tollefson at Iowa State University. This is an excellent rating system. More information is available at http://www.ent.iastate.edu/pest/rootworm/nodeinjury/nodeinjury.html. Essentially, the injury scale uses a decimal system. The number to the left of the decimal indicates the number of complete nodes (or equivalent number of nodes) of roots pruned back to within 1 ½ of the stalk. The number to the right of the decimal indicates the % of the next node of roots pruned. A root rating of 1.2 indicates the equivalent on one complete nodes of roots is pruned and 20% of the next.\\n\\nRelating injury to yield loss can be difficult because of several variables which include, weather, hybrid, etc. Typically, a field rating of greater than 0.75 indicates economic yields loss. Ratings less than 0.25 will probably not have economic loss. Injury between 0.25 and 0.75 is a gray area. Economic loss will be dependent on the factors mentioned above as well as compaction, general plant health and future environmental conditions.\\n\\nSurveying roots on first year corn will give you information regarding the prevalence and/or severity of damage from the rotation resistant western corn rootworm. Although damage to first year corn was originally diagnosed in Wisconsin during the 2002 growing season, its incidence has diminished. Also, there have been no reports of first year corn injury outside of southern Wisconsin. As we stress the need to revive IPM practices for corn rootworm, this information can give corn growers and crop consultants information needed to make an informed decision in rotated corn.\\n\\nLarval damage: notice root pruning on several nodes\\n\\nOne of the first tools needed for resistance management is documentation. Making a practice of evaluating roots from Bt CRW hybrids will give you the information needed to make appropriate management decisions that will help delay resistance. It is unlikely we can “turn the clock back” on resistance to individual Bt CRW proteins so early detection will be important. Resistance could be expected if you have a field average NIS of 1.0 and you have been using a single Bt toxin for two consecutive years or more. Or, if a field average, NIS rating of 0.5 or higher is noticed in a field that has used a pyramid Bt CRW toxin for at least two consecutive years. If resistance is expected, please contact your county extension agent as well as your seed dealer.\\n\\nA frequently asked question I get is how reliable is lodging as a predictor of larval feeding?\\n\\nThe short answer is that corn lodging is a very poor indicator of rootworm damage. Corn can lodge because of several causes. Rootworm feeding can be a reason but you still have to dig/wash roots to verify. Incidentally, you may have corn that is standing straight yet have significant rootworm feeding.',\n",

Stems and seed heads on orchardgrass and fescue had turned brown and the quality was poor. We still have a great and inexpensive option for quality forages this fall and winter, and without much effort or cost: stockpiling pastures and even hayfields for grazing.\\n\\nAfter feeding corn stalks, probably the lowest cost way to feed cattle in the fall and winter is to stockpile forages. Stockpiling means to make the last harvest by clipping or grazing of a hay field or pasture and then let it grow for grazing latter; in this situation, in the fall or winter. While most predominantly cool season grass based fields will work, fescue works the best as it maintains quality into and throughout the winter better. Many studies have demonstrated that one way to improve the quality and yield is to apply nitrogen (N) when stockpiling is initiated. Urea is the most common form of N used for stockpiling in most areas, but the biggest risk is applying the urea, then not getting a rain allowing much of the nitrogen to be lost by evaporating (volatilizing) in warm, dry conditions before it has a chance to react with the soil.\\n\\nOne product available to reduce nitrogen loss is Agrotain®, a urease inhibitor. Several universities have done research on urease inhibitors and the University of Kentucky has an excellent factsheet on Nitrogen Inhibitors (http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/agr/agr185/agr185.pdf).\\n\\nIn Southeast Ohio, studies and demonstrations have been conducted to evaluate quality and quantity of stockpiling cool season grasses such as fescue with no nitrogen (N), 100# of urea (46# N), 100# of urea with Agrotain®, and 218# of ammonium sulfate per acre (all treatments were 46# N per acre). We are in the third year of this study. Last year, we started the study July 31 and harvested the plots November 13. Plots with no N averaged 1781# of dry matter per acre, and the plots with N added ranged from 2757 to 3244# of dry matter per acre. Crude protein was also slightly higher when N was added for stockpiling (crude protein averaged 12.06% for the control plots and 12.26-12.91% when N was added). The one thing we can say at this point is that we get a yield and quality response when we add nitrogen. From a cost standpoint, urea is much less expensive than ammonium sulfate.\\n\\nAnother fertilizer option for stockpiling that was not used in these trials is 18-46-0 or DAP. In areas of Southeast Ohio where phosphorus levels are very low in pastures and hayfields, this can be an option and the nitrogen in this fertilizer is more stable than urea.\\n\\nSo, what do I recommend? As a farmer and an Extension Educator, I recommend stockpiling cool season grasses to reduce our need for stored forages. It can save money and definitely save time.\\n\\nI have been involved on and off with these studies for thirty years and also practicing this on my farm as well, and my conclusions are the earlier you begin stockpiling, the higher the yield and lower the quality. The later you begin stockpiling, the lower the yield and higher the quality. Quality and yield will go down the later you begin grazing.\\n\\nOn my farm, I keep a stockpiled field until March when my cows start calving and they really like the stockpiled grass, however I am seeing more deer grazing pressure waiting that long to graze in that field. Finally, adding N will increase yield and quality. If you have some pastures or even hay fields that you could set aside for fall and winter grazing, between now and mid-August would be a great time to start. In many situations, it may be the best winter forages we will have.',\n",

Insects and the harsh environment found in the Southeast were a contributing factor in the decline in production of alfalfa. Recent work with alfalfa mixtures has revealed new opportunities for this forage.\\n\\nGrowing Alfalfa in Alabama\\n\\nThis legume contains high levels of energy and protein. Known as the queen of forages, it is high yielding and is one of the best quality forages for hay, silage and pasture. In recent years, researchers created new varieties of alfalfa. These varieties are better able to battle and grow in these conditions. Thanks to these new varieties, alfalfa is once again a desirable forage in Alabama.\\n\\nRecent work with alfalfa has explored incorporating it into mixtures of bermudagrass. This mixture is desirable because alfalfa can help extend the forage growing season during the spring and fall months and improve the quality of harvested forage.\\n\\nDr. Kim Mullenix, an Alabama Extension animal science specialist, said that many believe that alfalfa cannot grow in the state.\\n\\n“Because we saw a decline in production, there is the misconception that alfalfa does not grow in the Southeast,” Mullenix said. “Historically, alfalfa grew throughout the Southeast. Recently, development of improved varieties has resulted in great potential for incorporation of alfalfa into forage systems in the region.”\\n\\nAn alfalfa stand may generally last three to five years, possibly longer. Growing alfalfa along with warm-season perennials such as bermudagrass comes with some risk to it that producers must manage. When the alfalfa plays out, the warm-season perennials will reclaim its dominance in the stand.\\n\\nSoil Requirements For Alfalfa\\n\\nMullenix said there are certain soil requirements that producers must maintain to grow alfalfa.\\n\\n“The site must be well-drained to allow deep rooting. For establishment, soil pH levels should be greater than 6.0 for topsoil. Subsoil pH levels need to be greater than 5.5,” Mullenix said. “Annual soil tests are critical, and producers should use amendments to maintain a target pH of 6.5.”\\n\\nPhosphorus and potassium are especially important nutrients when growing alfalfa. Its nutrient requirements may be high because when grown with grasses, there is competition for potassium.\\n\\nHarvesting Alfalfa Mixtures for Hay\\n\\nMullenix said the guidelines on harvesting alfalfa-bermudagrass mixtures for hay require attention to the stage of alfalfa growth, harvest interval and cutting height.\\n\\n“Harvest alfalfa during the early bloom stage (10 percent bloom) at the same height and interval as grazing,” Mullenix said. “When grown with bermudagrass, timing of harvest is critical early in the season, so warm-season perennials are not shaded out.”\\n\\nScout for Insects\\n\\nMullenix said to address any insect problems quickly, scout for insects in the alfalfa often, from spring through late fall.\\n\\n“Alfalfa weevils and aphids may cause problems early,” Mullenix said. “Caterpillars, 3-cornered alfalfa hoppers and blister beetles are found later in the season.”',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Rory Lewandowski\\n\\nIf you grow alfalfa, now is the time to scout those fields for potato leafhoppers. Integrated pest management (IPM) scouts are finding potato leafhoppers (PLH) widely distributed across a number of alfalfa fields. PLH numbers have ranged from low to well above economic treatment thresholds. In addition, alfalfa growers have been calling about yellow leaves on alfalfa, one of the classic PLH damage symptoms. Alfalfa growers should consider regular field scouting for PLH because this is one of the economically significant pests of alfalfa.\\n\\nThe potato leafhopper is a small bright green wedge shaped insect that arrives in our area each year on storm fronts from the Gulf Coast region. PLH is a sucking insect. PLH feeding causes stunting of alfalfa plants resulting in yield loss. Excessive stress on plants by heavy PLH feeding can result in yield reductions in the current as well as subsequent cuttings. A common symptom of PLH feeding is a wedge-shaped yellowing of leaf tips. If you are noticing these symptoms, some damage has been done. Regular scouting can help to detect PLH earlier and determine if there is a need for a rescue treatment.\\n\\nScouting involves the use of a sweep net. There is no other way to properly and accurately scout for PLH. The procedure is to take three to five samples for each 25 acres from random areas within the field. One sample consists of 10 pendulum sweeps. After the 10-sweep sample, carefully inspect the net contents and count the number of PLH adults and nymphs. For non-PLH resistant alfalfa varieties, treatment is warranted if the number of PLH adults and nymphs is equal to or greater than the average height of the alfalfa in inches.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy John F. Grimes\\n\\n\\n\\nAny successful beef producer understands the importance of effective management of grazed and harvested forages. Cow-calf producers, stocker operators, and feedlot managers share a common need for plentiful supplies of high quality forages for the entire year. Unfortunately, environmental factors can make the availability of consistent supplies available from year to year.\\n\\n\\n\\nUSDA NASS reported hay stocks on Ohio farms on May 1, 2018 were 280,000 tons, down 33% from this time last year. All hay stored on United States farms May 1, 2018 was down 36 percent from a year ago. As the summer months move along, producers have made one or more cuttings of hay to accumulate supplies for the winter of 2018-2019. This year’s harvest and carryover stocks from the previous winter will determine the forage management strategies that will be necessary to carry supplies through to the 2019 production season.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf producers are concerned that hay supplies will be tight to carry them through to the next growing season, they should consider a variety of strategies to supplement or preserve existing supplies. Here are a few management decisions to consider to insure adequate forage supplies to reach the 2019 growing season.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Old Faithful\\n\\nStockpiling is the time-tested method to take advantage of the late summer-fall growing conditions to obtain high-quality pasture for fall and early winter grazing. Consider grasses that will be responsive to nitrogen and hold their quality into the winter. Historically, fescue has been the most commonly used grass in this region for stockpiling. Kentucky bluegrass and orchardgrass are other common grasses used for stockpiling.\\n\\n\\n\\nStockpiling should typically begin by early to mid-August. Start by removing cattle from the pasture or clip the pasture so that 3-4 inches of forage remain. Topdressing 50 pounds of actual nitrogen per acre in mid-August can generate significant amounts of extra forage production. Kentucky research has shown an increase of 20 – 25 pounds of dry matter from Kentucky bluegrass and fescue for each pound of nitrogen applied. Grazing of stockpiled forages can begin in late fall to early winter depending on weather conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Plant a Winter Annual\\n\\nWinter varieties of wheat, triticale, cereal rye or ryegrass can be planted in the fall. Best results are usually obtained if planting is completed by early October. Winter small grain cereals commonly yield about 2 to 3 tons per acre. They offer the potential for light grazing (removing no more than half of the forage) in late fall – early winter. The bulk of the forage produced can be harvested through grazing in late winter – early spring. Producers can also utilize mechanical harvest as weather conditions allow. Harvesting the forage as baled silage as opposed to dry hay will insure a higher quality forage for feeding.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Secure Supplies Early\\n\\nIf you need to purchase extra hay, do so as early as possible. Hay prices will be more economical when purchased outside of the normal winter feeding season. If possible, purchase hay by weight and not by the bale to insure you are getting true value for your purchase. Not all hay is created equal so request a nutrient analysis of the hay being purchased in order to match the nutritional needs of the targeted production group.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Waste Not, Want Not\\n\\nWhen selecting the storage location for all cuttings of hay this season, think about how the hay will be fed next winter. Arrange the accessibility of the different types and cuttings of hay based on the various production groups and calving season of your herd. Account for potential weather challenges and the probable location where animals will be fed next winter. Make sure to document location of the different types, cuttings, and quality of hay being stored. Check out this video on proper hay storage techniques that would minimize storage losses located at the OSU Extension Beef Team’s YouTube Channel at: https://youtu.be/8nF65KQzx7k\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Eliminate the “Freeloaders”\\n\\nDetermining the pregnancy status of beef cattle continues to be one of the most underutilized yet relatively easy to implement management practices available to beef producers. Today, there are three basic technologies available to the producer for pregnancy checking: traditional palpation, ultrasound, and blood testing. The most obvious reason for pregnancy checking is to identify non-pregnant or open females for sale as a means to reduce feed expenses. Keep in mind that once a female is diagnosed open, it will be a minimum of approximately 300 days before this female will deliver a calf and another 6-8 months before you can sell a calf. This is simply too long of a period to accumulate expenses without the female providing the opportunity for income. If cows are not being productive for you, they need to be replaced.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: osu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Adam Russell\\n\\nBollworm in cotton boll.\\n\\nCotton producers who planted Bt pest-resistant varieties in some parts of the state are seeing damage from bollworms, so vigilant monitoring and management may be necessary to prevent losses, said a Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service expert.\\n\\nDr. David Kerns, AgriLife Extension integrated pest management state coordinator in College Station, said there has been a “huge” bollworm egg lay throughout much of the Upper Gulf Coast and central Blacklands areas. The bollworm in cotton, known as the earworm in corn and the headworm in sorghum, feed as larvae on cotton fruit and grain on corn and sorghum.\\n\\nThis pest represents one of the most damaging for Texas agricultural producers, Kerns said. Infestations are airborne, arriving with the migration of moths that lay eggs in the three crops. Over the last two weeks, large numbers of eggs have been spotted in cotton fields.\\n\\nKerns said the bollworms appeared to have moved into cotton primarily from the previous generation that had infested corn. It is thought the current bollworm generation has developed some resistance to some cotton Bt technologies by feeding on similar technologies in corn. Bacillus thuringiensis, referenced as Bt, is a spore-forming soil bacterium that produces protein crystals toxic to many types of insects.\\n\\n“Bollworms have shown a lot of resistance the last few years, and they’re persisting this year,” Kerns said. “We’ve seen a lot of damage in fields that have Bt technology. All of the cotton Bt technologies had experienced some degree of failure, except for varieties containing Bt-Vip technology, which seems to be holding up very well.”\\n\\nBt cotton was genetically modified with resistance targeting tobacco budworm in 1996, Kerns said. Since then the primary pest of concern has shifted to the bollworm. Bt technology in cotton started with one toxin, then evolved to include two toxins and most recently three Bt toxins. The larvae that feed on the plant expressing the Bt die.\\n\\nCurrent Bt in cotton is specific towards caterpillar pests and is harmless to beneficial insects, Kerns said.\\n\\nBut like many pests, the bollworms’ resistance to toxins has evolved as well, and the data demonstrates that bollworms have developed resistance to all the Bt toxins in cotton except the Vip toxin, he said.\\n\\nKerns said cotton varieties containing Vip technology also include two additional Bt Cry toxins, and the combination of these toxins appears to be working on bollworms.\\n\\n“It appears that any variety with just two Cry toxins is having problems and those with the addition of Vip look good,” he said. “We’re seeing extensive damage in test plots, but cotton producers are aware of the problem and are treating cotton as needed to prevent yield loss.”\\n\\nKerns said dryland fields that received moisture bounced back well, but infestations could put yields in jeopardy if not properly managed.\\n\\nBollworm eggs typically hatch in three to four days, and the larval stage continues for almost two weeks, he said.\\n\\nMost producers are monitoring for bollworm and staying on top of the situation in individual fields, Kerns said. But multiple egg lays mean producers in the area need to monitor and producers in the northern Blacklands need to be watching their fields closely as moths produced from corn begin to emerge there.\\n\\nKerns said producers should not assume Bt cotton will prevent bollworm damage and they should stay vigilant and note numbers, especially in non-Vip Bt cotton fields. Treatment of fields with insecticides early before the worms make their way to the fruit is the best tactic for optimal control. In areas where Bt resistance has been previously noted, spraying on large egg lay areas has proven highly effective.\\n\\nBut Kerns said treatment of Vip cotton varieties should be based solely on damaged fruit with larvae present because treating those fields in most often not necessary.\\n\\n“In non-Vip cotton in areas where we have had Bt-resistance issues, if I have a large egg lay, I’m going to spray,” he said. “With Vip cotton, they tend to work, so you can avoid the added cost of spray treatments by just letting them do their job.”\\n\\nHowever, even Vip cotton can experience unacceptable injury from bollworms under certain conditions, and should be treated once 6 percent or more fruit injury occurs with larvae present, he said.\\n\\nAgriLife Extension district reporters compiled the following summaries:\\n\\nCENTRAL: Recent rains were not enough to keep pastures from burning up, and most producers didn’t get a second cutting on hay. Hay production was down drastically. Row crops were suffering and livestock were being supplemented. A lot of grain sorghum was cut for hay because heads were not making grain. A little more than half of the counties reported fair soil moisture. Overall crop, rangeland and pasture conditions were fair in more than half of the counties.\\n\\nROLLING PLAINS: Weather in the district remained hot, dry and windy with some spotty showers. Cotton farmers wrapped up planting, however some acres were replanted due to weather conditions. Early planted cotton acres avoided the disastrous weather and were in good condition but needed rain. Pastures and rangelands were in good condition but also needed rain. Grasses were drying out, and wildfires were becoming a concern. One county reported over 1,500 acres burned. Hay was being used as a supplement in dry pastures. Grasshopper damage was occurring in pastures and yards.\\n\\nCOASTAL BEND: Scattered showers limited access to fields to harvest sorghum and corn. Harvest-aid applications to prevent lodging were delayed on some sorghum. Moisture levels fluctuated in grain day to day from 13 percent to 18 percent following a tropical front. Cotton bolls were opening, and a few early planted cotton fields were defoliated. Herbicide application continued as weather allowed. Some hay was being made, but conditions were not great. Livestock were doing well.\\n\\nEAST: Scattered showers eased dry soil conditions in many areas across the district. Water levels were still down in most lakes and ponds in Gregg and Cherokee counties, which caused difficulties for many livestock producers. Cherokee County was still in drought. Trinity County reported hard winds dried out soil following rains. Producers were still trying to find hay to purchase outside of Trinity County, and Smith County’s supply was running very low. Marion County reported some producers were having to start feeding hay and Gregg County producers continued hay feeding. Pasture and rangeland conditions were in fair to good condition throughout the district. Marion County gardens were drying up unless they were being watered. Subsoil and topsoil conditions were short. Livestock were in fair to good condition. Fly and mosquito numbers remained high in Henderson and Houston counties. Wild pigs continued to cause a lot of damage in Henderson County.\\n\\nSOUTH PLAINS: Hot, dry weather kept subsoil and topsoil moisture levels low despite spotty showers. Most areas were still in extreme drought. Cotton fleahopper numbers continued to be very low to non-existent. Some early planted cotton was blooming, and areas fortunate enough to receive moisture looked good. Remaining cotton fields were struggling, and growers were going back in failed acres with either cotton or sorghum. There were no signs of sugarcane aphids in sorghum. Weed and pest control remained priority No. 1 for producers. Pastures and rangelands needed rain. Peanuts were doing very well with most fields in bloom and beginning to set pegs.\\n\\nPANHANDLE: Temperatures were near average, but soil moisture was mostly short. Some moisture was received in parts of the district. Deaf Smith County producers all but wrapped up wheat harvest. Producers continued to run water on corn and cotton. Field work was ongoing with compost and manure trucks starting to operate. Mild weather and scattered showers in Moore County improved crop outlooks. Producers in Ochiltree County plowed and sprayed fallow ground and crops to control weeds. Sorghum planting was complete. Rangeland and pastures in some areas were in very good condition after heavy rains in June. Recent hail and high winds severely damaged or destroyed a large number of cotton acres in Wheeler County.\\n\\nNORTH: Topsoil and subsoil moisture levels were mostly short due to extremely high temperatures and lack of measurable rainfall. Wheat harvest was completed, and yields averaged about 50 bushels per acre. Hay harvest continued, but yields were about half what they were last year due to lack of moisture. Cotton began to bloom. Pastures and hay meadows were stressed from no rain. Wild pig activity was low.\\n\\nFAR WEST: Temperature highs were in the upper 90s with lows in the high 60s. Most parts of the district received rainfall ranging from trace amounts to more than 3 inches. Multiple pop-up rain showers combined with cooler temperatures and helped perk cotton up. Very few cotton acres survived, but acres that survived looked decent. Pest numbers increased. Spider mites were infesting corn and sorghum. Watermelon harvest was in full swing. Producers continued to water all crops. Shipping of kid and lambs was finishing up. Fire danger was less, but a few small grass fires occurred.\\n\\nWEST CENTRAL: Conditions were hot and dry with isolated rain showers. Rain amounts ranged from a trace to 2 inches. Cotton planting was complete. Substantial cotton acres showed little to no emergence due to drought conditions, though some areas provided marginal stands. Some storm damage occurred in crops. Overall crop conditions were fair. Sorghum fields were in fair to good condition. Forage sorghum and hay fields were in fair to good condition, but were showing drought stress. Rangeland and pasture conditions were mostly poor to fair. Tank levels were still low, but rains helped.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Mary Drewnoski\\n\\nFigure 1. Cattle grazing cereal rye cover crop near Tecumseh. Often grazing poses less of a nitrate toxicity risk than haying and feeding.\\n\\nPlanting cover crops after severe wind or hail damage to crops is becoming increasingly common. Often growers are planting species that have been used as forages for many years with the thought that they may be grazed.\\n\\nIf these cover crops are to be grazed, growers need to consider that many of these species have the potential to accumulate high levels of nitrates. The specific level at which nitrates become risky to cattle is unknown; however, with careful grazing, haying, and livestock management the potential for livestock losses can be reduced.\\n\\nThe potential for high nitrate concentrations is more of a concern with haying than with grazing. All annual grasses and brassicas can accumulate nitrate. The brassicas accumulate more than grasses, but they are also higher energy. This may help offset some of the toxicity concerns. We have grazed some very high nitrate fields with no issues.\\n\\nHaying is a different story. Currently recommended levels of risk are based on hay feeding. Levels above 2100 ppm of N03-N are considered high risk, which is appropriate. The potential for nitrate toxicity is lower in grazed forages than in hay with the same level of nitrate due to the following factors:\\n\\nGrazing animals eat more gradually than those receiving hay.\\n\\nWhen cattle are grazing, they tend to be selective and do not graze the entire field close to the ground (where nitrate is highest). This means that if allowed access to the field (not strip grazed), they will likely consume the plant parts with lower nitrate concentration first. This will reduce the amount of nitrates consumed during the grazing period.\\n\\nFresh (high-moisture) forages release nitrates into the rumen at a slower rate than dry forages such as hay.\\n\\nCattle consuming high-energy diets can handle more nitrates than those on low-energy diets. Many of the cover crops grazed are very high energy, including the brassicas and immature grasses.\\n\\nIt should be noted that allowing a warm-season summer annual to reach maturity and stockpiling it for winter grazing will reduce nitrate toxicity susceptibility. Although toxicity concerns will be less than with hay since the animal can be selective and intake will be slower, the buffer of high moisture or high energy is reduced.\\n\\nTable 1. Nitrate potential of oats and brassicas planted for grazed forage\\n\\nFORAGE N0 3 -N, PPM ANIMAL YEAR oat, turnip, radish 6146 steers 2014 oat, turnip, radish 4655 steers 2015 oat, turnip, radish 2158 heifers 2015 oats (south paddock) 912 steers 2015 oats (north paddock) 4414 steers 2015 oats (north paddock) 3921 steers 2016 oats (south paddock) 8026 steers 2016\\n\\nFor example, during the past few years we have grazed calves on fall cover crops. When analyzed for nitrates, these would be considered extremely high risk (see Table 1). However, no signs of toxicity were noted and calves gained 1.3 to 2.2 lb/day (low rate of gain was in 2015 with extended cold/wet weather). In all instances, calves were allowed to be selective (access to the whole field at once; 60 days of grazing). Forage quality was very high (above 65% TDN).\\n\\nTo summarize, nitrate toxicity will always be a concern when planting cover crops for forage in hail-damaged crop fields. Grazing cover crops with elevated nitrate concentrations does have some risk, which can be reduced with careful management.\\n\\nManagement Strategies to Mitigate Nitrate Toxicity\\n\\nMake sure cattle are full before putting them on fields. Regardless of the nitrate level, a good management practice is to fill cattle up with hay before turn-out.\\n\\nUse lower risk cattle, if possible. The group with the greatest risk of negative consequences due to feeding on high-nitrate forages is pregnant cows, as abortion can result. Open cows are the best option followed by growing calves (stockers or developing replacement heifers before breeding).\\n\\nGradual adaptation is a key management strategy to minimize risk when using high nitrate forages. Losses from nitrate toxicity will be much greater in cattle not adapted to nitrate. The bacteria in the rumen capable of degrading nitrite to ammonia for bacterial protein synthesis will increase when nitrate is available to them. Adapted animals can safely be fed higher levels. To adapt the cattle, start by grazing the lowest-nitrate fields and then work up to the highest.\\n\\nGraze higher N fields lightly to allow animals to selectively graze plant parts that are lower in nitrate concentration. Nitrate level varies with location in the plant. Nitrate tends to accumulate in the lower stem, so overgrazing so that cattle have to eat the lower stem can cause an increased intake of nitrate.\\n\\nConsider grain supplementation while adapting cattle to high-nitrate, lower quality forages such as mature sorghum x sudangrass hybrids or pearl millet. This will supply energy for rumen microbes to convert nitrate into bacterial protein and minimizes the intermediate nitrite production. Brassicas, such as turnips and radishes, are highly digestible and as such may provide enough energy to allow for increased microbial protein synthesis. Grain feeding may be of limited benefit for high quality cover crops.\\n\\nUltimately, the decision to graze high nitrate fields is a judgment call and a question of how much risk a producer is willing to take.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Christine Gelley\\n\\n\\n\\nMud, nutrient leaching, and erosion are a few of the ailments pastures across our region are experiencing in 2018. It can be a challenge to be thankful for rain in years like this. You’ve likely witnessed it wash away freshly planted seed, topsoil, and nutrients while trudging through swamps that should be access roads, watching seed heads develop on valuable hay, and cutting fallen limbs off damaged fence.\\n\\n\\n\\nNature has taunted many this season. In Southeast Ohio, opportunities to make hay have been few and far between due to soggy soil conditions and high humidity. The longer harvest is delayed, the poorer nutritive value becomes. Most producers have probably harvested first cutting hay that will barely meet requirements for animal maintenance. Looking beyond the frustration to solutions, there are things we can do to relieve the pressure that heavy rainfall inflicts on hayfields and grazed pastures.\\n\\n\\n\\nMud Management\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the best ways to manage mud in grazing situations is to keep animals moving and give pastures rest. Split large paddocks into smaller paddocks and rotate animals frequently. Fence out areas that are extremely wet. Both practices reduce damage from hoof traffic.\\n\\n\\n\\nRotating animals among smaller paddocks will also make manure distribution more uniform and help prevent erosion. Adjust rotation lengths and stocking densities to keep forage vegetative. If seed heads develop during the rest period, make plans to come back and clip them when the ground is dry. Clipping will re-stimulate the plants and lower your risk for fescue toxicity issues later on.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you must take equipment into the pasture, opt for smaller loads and use extreme caution on slopes. Use light implements that have tires with substantial surface area. If you get stuck, get help early. The harder you try to get unstuck alone, the harder it will be for someone to help you.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrient Management\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving a good stand of legumes (20 percent or more) in the pasture can help replace leached nitrogen and reduce the need for a nitrogen application. Stands that are primarily grasses will be drastically improved with split applications of nitrogen.\\n\\n\\n\\nNitrogen is removed from pastures through volatilization, harvest, and leaching. Hay fields will have a more crucial need for nitrogen than grazed pastures, because the forage is removed from the site, rather than replaced by nitrogen in urine and manure.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn application between first and second cutting can be beneficial if volatilization risks can be reduced. A third application could also be useful if there is intent to stockpile the forage for late fall or winter grazing. The amount needed depends on yield goals, actual forage removal, spring fertilization, soil pH, and grass species.\\n\\n\\n\\nGrazed pastures may need additional fertilizer part way through the growing season as well, but no more than one third of the pasture should be fertilized at a time to lower risks of nitrate toxicity for grazing animals.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlood Conditions\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your pasture goes from soggy to flooded, keep in mind that water flow patterns can flush soil, weed seeds, manure, and microbes into the pasture and cause concerns for animal health.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf deposited silt levels are too high, animals may accidently consume substantial amounts while grazing, which can cause digestive issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nWeed seeds can be swept into the pasture and establish themselves in the damaged areas, crowding out the desirable forages during flood recovery. Detrimental weeds taking over damaged areas will reduce intake of high quality forages and may pose risks if poisonous plants become established. In times of pasture stress, animals are more likely to consume poisonous plants in an effort to find enough to eat.\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrobes and parasites are also easily transported into grazing pastures if water flows through an area of manure or sewage storage. It would be best to wait a week or two to return animals to pastures that have been flooded with tainted water. This will help maintain good herd health.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the water has drained from the pasture and the soil, investigate if there are any management decisions you could make now to reduce damage if a duplicate flooding event occurred. Consider reseeding heavily damaged areas. Choose varieties that will withstand the conditions of your operation.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider planting an annual forage to compensate in such areas as an emergency crop while you plan for the long term. Planting an annual forage will reduce further erosion, provide competition for weeds, and supply feed for animals more quickly than perennials. Annual ryegrass offers excellent tolerance to poorly drained soils, wheat has good tolerance, while oats, rye, and sorghum-sudangrass offer fair tolerance.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t forget to eliminate standing water whenever possible to prevent mosquito development and reduce the risk of disease transmission for both animals and people.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: osu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Eric Bailey\\n\\nRelease of CRP land for grazing in northern Missouri gives relief for some cow herds on drought-shorted pastures.\\n\\nThe Conservation Reserve Program with USDA Farm Service Agency pays farmers to keep erosion-prone land out of production. It now allows short-term grazing in 42 counties in northern Missouri. Under current grazing terms that use ends July 15. That may be extended.\\n\\nThe counties are mostly north of a line from Kansas City to Marshall to Hannibal.\\n\\nMany restrictions apply on land use. First, farmers must request and receive approval in writing before use. Only certain CRP programs are eligible.\\n\\nProducers are urged to get all rules from their local FSA office. Owners of CRP land can lease grazing rights. Haying isn’t allowed.\\n\\nEric Bailey, University of Missouri beef nutritionist, says to use released forage with caution.\\n\\nIn normal times, the land isn’t intended for grazing. It isn’t regularly burned, grazed or hayed. That allows low-quality forage to accumulate.\\n\\n“Producers must realize CRP forage will be poor quality,” Bailey says. “It will be below 50 percent total digestible nutrients (TDN) and 7 percent crude protein. It may not be palatable.”\\n\\nThose low nutrients should not be expected to support cows nursing young calves or for growing feeder calves, Bailey says. “Additional feed must be used.”\\n\\n“CRP forage should be used as part of a total mixed ration,” he adds. “CRP forage may need significant supplemental energy.”\\n\\nMU livestock specialists can assist with planning rations. Contacts are through local extension centers.\\n\\nIn addition, the MU Ag Electronic Bulletin Board (agebb.missouri.edu(opens in new window)) on the internet helps. It lists current prices and sources for commodity feeds such as distillers grains, corn gluten pellets, wheat midds and soyhulls used in most feed rations.\\n\\nA starting point is 5 to 7 pounds of these feeds per cow of any of the above feeds.\\n\\nPregnant fall-calving cows likely need only 5 to 7 pounds of these feeds per day at this point. Expect cows nursing calves to need 1 percent (12 to 15 pounds) of their body weight per day if pastures are short.\\n\\nIn drought-stressed areas, herd owners can be proactive in feed management. The next calf crop depends on it. By fitting supplement to cow needs, costs can be lowered.\\n\\nBailey warns that even with recent rains, most areas have lost the bountiful spring growth on pastures. “Expect poor pastures to persist through the rest of this growing season.”\\n\\nIf FSA extends CRP releases, that will end Sept. 30. Now, grazing must be limited to 75 percent of each field. Minimum stubble heights must be left.\\n\\nIf CRP forage fails due to grazing, it must be replanted at expense of CRP owners. There are more rules.\\n\\nBailey says, “Remember, MU Extension is here to help.” Contacts are in local centers in each county.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Kris Ringwall\\n\\n“Did you check your review mirror?” is an often-asked question because one cannot move forward without knowing from where one came.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe challenges of years past still were challenges, just like the challenges of today. One human weakness is the reluctance to read, study and learn from the past and then use what was learned to move forward. It pays to check the review mirror.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne big difference today is the speed at which information can be obtained, presented and processed. What does this have to do with the beef business? Sister operations - swine or poultry - compete with beef for the consumer market share.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood options continue to expand, even to the current issues of what actually is meat. Does the meat have to come from an animal that breathes, reproduces and eats?\\n\\n\\n\\nGrain remains a relatively inexpensive source of feed, a feed source the cattle industry competes for with swine, poultry and humans. The human use of grain and plant products has expanded far beyond food use, a cause to spend time pausing and pondering.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf one broadens the grass world to forage, forage that once was expected to feed livestock today perhaps is a biofuel. Where do cattle fit? As one looks at all plants, considerable time has been spent on the yield of seed, and less emphasis has been placed on forage yield.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs plants are selected, genetically or managerially, to maximize seed production, the potential edible nutritional products contained in the leaves and stems may be minimized, resulting in decreased forage quality or even limited acceptability as a grazing plant. When selection is focused on forage production, forage for biofuels is not high-quality forage for livestock.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is a lot to ponder.\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps I could add three areas that need to be pondered for the future. The first is that beef producers need to embrace technology to:\\n\\nObtain meaningful metrics that support management\\n\\nDiscover new genomic advantages\\n\\nImplement successful methodologies in field and pasture sourcing\\n\\nMeasure and review genetic and environmental interactions\\n\\nFollow animals throughout the entire production chain\\n\\nUse data to drive and provide vitality within the plant and animal genome\\n\\nProvide sustainable practices for resources while producing high-quality food\\n\\nThe second area is that beef producers need to incorporate research results that:\\n\\nRefocus delivery methods\\n\\nEngage mobile technology\\n\\nUpdate data access methods and speed\\n\\nAllow the multiple classroom environments to expand knowledge\\n\\nShare data and information 24/7 via web-based portals to extend classroom learning environments into tangible production and experiential settings\\n\\nConnect and prepare future generations for outcomes and decisions made now\\n\\nThe third area is a better understanding and improvement of the very soil on which forage and livestock thrive to:\\n\\nPreserve natural resources\\n\\nFind and utilize symbiotic relationships within production systems\\n\\nNurture producer/consumer relationships\\n\\nInvest in sustainable decisions that boost soil health and productivity\\n\\nFind plant rotations that lower input costs and increase per-acre outputs\\n\\nDevelop complementary diverse production models using available nutrients and moisture that integrate well with expanded genomic evaluation and meet consumer desires\\n\\nPonder these thoughts and add in some reflection on a strong business sense and managerial fine-tuning. The future beef business will utilize more technology, more research and a better soil/plant model, coupled with more business planning and expanded markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beef business is a low-margin business. Having said that, the incorporation of more technology into low-margin businesses is a challenge. Profitable beef means utilizing key financial tools integrated with managerial flexibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn closing, the cow-calf business is a grass-based business. Three questions arise:\\n\\nIs the future of beef a residual, low-margin side business of crop agriculture?\\n\\nIs the future of beef a residual, low-input side business of grassland agriculture?\\n\\nIs the future of beef a business that measures inputs and outputs while producing a food product recognized for its nutritional value and eating pleasure?\\n\\nAll three are evident today. So, we should ponder about the future. The cow-calf business is not a simple business with cookie-cutter solutions. The business means hard work with low margins, low inputs and no excess. Keep pondering soil, forage and beef.\\n\\nSource: ndsu.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Christy Sprague\\n\\nA black bean field affected by Sharpen carryover near Port Austin, Michigan.\\n\\nSharpen is an effective harvest aid in dry beans, but has the potential to cause problems when dry beans follow dry beans.\\n\\nSharpen 2.85L (saflufenacil) is a herbicide labeled for use as a harvest aid in dry edible beans and has been an effective dry bean desiccant in Michigan State University trials and grower fields. Sharpen has similar speed of activity as Gramoxone and is quicker than glyphosate and Valor. Sharpen is a contact herbicide, so desiccation is dependent on good spray coverage. Sharpen can be applied at rates up to 2 fluid ounces per acre. However, in MSU trials, 1 fluid ounce per acre of Sharpen with MSO (1 percent v/v) + AMS has provided similar desiccation as 2 fluid ounces per acre, so we recommend the 1 fluid ounce per acre rate.\\n\\nThe application timing for Sharpen is when the dry bean crop is mature, at least 80 percent of the pods should be yellowing and mostly ripe and no more than 40 percent (bush-type beans) or 30 percent (vine-type beans) of leaves still green. There is a two-day pre-harvest restriction between applying Sharpen and dry bean harvest, however it generally takes seven days to reach maximum desiccation activity.\\n\\nCrop rotation should also be considered when using Sharpen as a pre-harvest herbicide. Winter wheat can be planted immediately after dry bean harvest. However, if rotating to sugar beets, take special precautions. The rotation restrictions for sugar beets are four months for a 1 fluid ounce per acre application rate of Sharpen and five months for a 2 fluid ounce per acre rate, this excludes months where the ground is frozen.\\n\\nI was recently called out to a black bean field where the grower described his beans as “dying in waves” (see photo). In conversing with the grower, I learned he had planted navy beans there the previous year. The grower had applied 2 ounces of Sharpen Oct. 14 on his 2017 navy beans, and had planted his 2018 black beans June 7. The rotation restriction for dry beans following dry beans is six months, again excluding months where the ground is frozen.\\n\\nThe weeds on the borders of the field were unaffected, so drift was eliminated as a cause of the damage. I reviewed the soil temperature data from the nearest MSU Enviroweather station, which is about 7 miles away from the field. The ground froze on Dec. 9 and remained frozen through Feb. 20. The ground was unfrozen for 161 days, or 5.3 months, between application and dry bean planting.\\n\\nIn talking with MSU Extension weed specialist Christy Sprague, her best guess is Sharpen carryover caused the beans to die. If you intend to plant a sensitive crop (sugar beets, dry beans) after a Sharpen application, be mindful of the number of days the ground has been unfrozen between application and planting of the sensitive crop, particularly if the full 2 ounce rate is used.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Big Are the Pulse Stockpiles?\\n\\nBased on some of the amped up talk about Indian pulse tariffs and how they’re restricting Canadian exports, you’d think there’s no end to the big supplies of pulses on Canadian farms. That’s not to say there hasn’t been a serious impact on Canadian exports, but the supply situations are quite mixed for the different types of pulses.\\n\\nThis week, StatsCan released its export data for April and pea exports were shown to have jumped to 346,000 tonnes after a string of mediocre months. And the weekly data from the CGC shows an unusual flurry of export activity in May, extending the April streak. It’s true that pea exports are still well behind last year’s record pace but thanks to Chinese buyers, the outlook for peas is looking a little brighter.\\n\\nOverall, this late-season improvement in pea exports is helping trim estimates for 2017/18 ending stocks. Earlier in the year, there were some suggestions there would be over a million tonnes of peas left at the end of 2017/18. Now, it’s looking more like pea ending stocks will be around 600,000 tonnes. That’s still large, but lower than a few other years when stocks were much more burdensome.\\n\\nWhen we look at export performance of green peas specifically, we see there’s been no drop-off at all this year. That includes India, which has continued to buy green peas. In fact, Canadian green pea exports for Aug-Apr are 220,000 tonnes, ahead of last year at 205,000 tonnes. The result is that green pea ending stocks are becoming quite tight, as evidenced by some $9.00 per bushel bids.\\n\\nThis improved stocks situation is also positive for the 2018/19 outlook. Because fewer old-crop peas will be carried forward into the next marketing year, those supplies won’t be as heavy either. Of course, a lot depends on this year’s yield outcomes which are still far from clear. The acreage split between yellows and greens is also an important factor. Even so, it’s possible Canadian pea supplies could actually start to look tightish in 2018/19, which would be a fairly quick turnaround from this year’s doom and gloom.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the same cautiously optimistic outlook doesn’t apply to lentils. While there’s been some improvement in Canadian exports the last couple of months, it’s still not enough to make a significant dent in Canadian lentil supplies. That said, I’m not quite as pessimistic as some reports that suggest 2017/18 lentil ending stocks could be around a million tonnes. Still, our current ending stocks estimate of 750-800,000 tonnes is back up to the levels seen a number of years ago, when lentil bids were even a bit lower than they are now.\\n\\nOne of the differences for lentils (compared to peas) is that there isn’t a “China” waiting in the wings to scoop up large supplies. Canada is still heavily dependent on India, especially for red lentils. That means it would likely take a crop failure there to turn the market higher and, at the earliest, that wouldn’t be evident until early 2019, if at all.\\n\\nOf course, a problem with the Canadian lentil crop would also “help” the supply situation, but that’s not something we’re counting on either. Even if that happened, carrying over 800,000 tonnes of old-crop lentils would soften the impact of a smaller 2018 Canadian crop. This means that unless there’s a serious crop production problem somewhere, the lentil market will remain under pressure for longer than peas.\\n\\nChickpeas and dry beans aren’t facing the same type of large ending stocks, due to strong export programs. In fact, the 2017/18 marketing year will end up with very few chickpeas or beans left in farmers’ bins or traders’ inventories. Chickpea production is expected to rebound significantly, replenishing supplies, but dry bean supplies could get even tighter in 2018/19.\\n\\nSource : Albertapulse',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy: THE OMAFRA FIELD CROP TEAM\\n\\nCorn\\n\\nMany areas of the province saw rain over the weekend putting a stop to field activities for a day or two. Corn planting is wrapping up and progressing well with corn emerging as quickly as four days after planting. The earlier planted corn is at the V3-V6 stage and the corn planted later on the heavier ground is from planted to the V2 stage. There have been some corn replants primarily due to excessive rainfall; however, the number of replants is below average. Side-dressing is underway in some areas and will likely be in full swing next week. OMAFRA Field Crop staff have begun soil nitrate survey sampling to gauge levels at various sites across the province. Results will be posted to FieldCropNews.com as they are made available. Since these PSNT values are collected from specific fields, it is important to realize they are intended to give an idea of what is happening with soil N across the province. Since soil N levels vary greatly because of soil type, crop history, fertility, addition of manures, etc., growers are reminded that proper recommendations for specific fields can only be made based on quality samples taken directly from those fields.\\n\\nSoybeans\\n\\nMany areas are completely finished with soybean planting with the exception of heavier soils in Essex, Chatham-Kent, Lambton and Niagara. The crop ranges from the cotyledon to second trifoliate growth stage. Due to the quick emerging crop, not all intended burndowns or pre-emergence herbicides were applied. As a result, a number of fields are dealing with heavy weed pressure. Weeds grew relatively quickly last week but with the recent cool weather growth have slowed down. Weed control during the early stages of soybean growth are critical. When timing post-emergence herbicide applications the growth stage of target weeds is generally more important than the growth stage of the soybeans. Bean leaf beetle feeding has been observed in Essex County; however, thresholds have not been reached.\\n\\nSome re-planting has occurred in areas that received excessive moisture. Conversely, there have been reports of poor stands where seed wasn’t planted into moisture, particularly in Huron and Bruce Counties. The number of plant stand issues so far has been low compared to most years.\\n\\nForages\\n\\nFirst-cut alfalfa is in full swing, with most dairy hay finished. Yields and quality have been good to date. Alfalfa weevil has been found in many areas. Scouting for feeding on regrowth after first-cut is important as weevils are entering the most damaging stages of third and fourth instars during the early stages of crop regrowth. Control is warranted if there are two or more active larvae per crown, or 4–8 larvae per 30 cm by 30 cm (1 ft2).\\n\\nWinter wheat\\n\\nThe winter wheat crop is progressing well. Fusarium Head Blight fungicides have started to go on in the southwest portion of the province. However, due to the crop progressing quickly and the ideal window for a T3 fungicide passing, a number of acres in the southwest did not receive a T3 fungicide. As the crop progresses eastward growers are reminded to scout their fields for proper fungicide timing. Stripe rust has been reported in Ontario on June 5th in the St. Mary’s area on a susceptible variety.\\n\\nSpecific variety ratings for stripe rust can be found in the Ontario Cereals Crops Committee Performance trial data at www.gocereals.ca. Growers who have not yet applied their T3 fungicide and have a susceptible variety should continue to scout their fields and wait for the proper T3 fungicide timing if possible. Early spring cereal fields are at first to second node. Cereal leaf beetle (CLB) continues to be found in a number of non-traditional areas including Essex and Niagara Counties. Continue to scout for CLB in winter wheat if crop is approaching heading. One CLB adult or larvae per stem warrants control after boot but prior to heading. It is also important to scout for CLB in spring cereals as the crops progress.\\n\\nCanola\\n\\nCanola is progressing well with most of the crop between the 3 and at the 5 leaf stage. Flea beetle is being reported in canola; however, flea beetles are less active in the cool weather. Remember that flea beetle must feed on the seedlings to be exposed to seed treatment insecticides. Foliar insecticide application is not warranted until at least 25% foliar feeding is observed, and once the crop is at the 4 leaf stage it can likely outgrow the feeding damage.\\n\\nSwede midge emergence was reported last week in the areas of Shelburne and Elora, and emergence is likely occurring now in all canola growing regions. Swede midge pheromone traps should be in place now and checked every few days through to bolting. Information on swede midge can be found on FieldCropNews.com\\n\\nEdible Beans\\n\\nPlanting is about 30% complete with the remaining acres expected to be planted later this week and into next week\\n\\nSource : Field Crop News',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanting of all crops is much further along than last week, although the general comments about slow progress on fine textured soils are still applicable. Regions with clay soils are dry on top but gummy below, so delays continue. There is rain in the forecast this week for much of southern Ontario so further delays are a possibility.\\n\\nCorn\\n\\nWhile planting is mostly complete in many parts of the province, operations continued over the past week on finer textured soils and localized areas which had been receiving frequent rainfalls. Georgian Central region is reported to be close to 75% complete while growers in parts of Kent, Essex and Lambton are continuing planting as well. This has been the first window of significant corn planting on finer textured soils in Essex, Lambton, Elgin and Haldimand/Niagara areas which are pushing hard to catch up before the next rainfall.\\n\\nStaging is variable depending on planting date. While some corn is still being planted, a large portion of the crop is in the V2-V3 stage, with more advanced fields approaching V4 to V5. Warm weather and the good soil conditions for the majority, have resulted in reports of excellent, uniform stands across most of the province.\\n\\nSoybeans\\n\\nIn regions where corn planting is complete, growers are pushing through completion of soybean acres as well. Soybean planting is estimated to be around 80% complete. Planting progress on heavier soils continues to move slowly, including in Essex, Lambton, and parts of Haldimand and Niagara.\\n\\nThe heat over the past week is encouraging soybeans to emerge within a week of planting. Most soybeans are currently at the cotyledon to unifoliate stage, and earlier planted fields are in the first trifoliate stage. Populations are uniform and looking good, except on heavier textured soils where crusting has become a problem. Leaving a thin stand that is uniform is often more profitable than replanting. On most soil types, do not replant a stand of more than 222,000 plants/ha (90,000 plants/acre), in 19 cm (7.5 in.) row spacing. Heavy clay soils need a minimum of less than 250,000 plants/ha (110,000 plants/acre) before a replant is worthwhile.\\n\\nThe warm weather has led to fast growth of weeds, and in some cases soybeans emerging before burndown herbicide treatments were applied. Where soybeans have emerged, there is a risk of crop injury with many of the herbicides commonly tank-mixed with glyphosate. Some weeds like lamb’s-quarter have been observed moving from cotyledon to 4 leaf stage within two days. Note weed growth stages in your field and plan to time herbicide applications early enough to get good control.\\n\\nCereals:\\n\\nMany winter wheat fields are variable in colour (Fig. 1). It is suspected that non-uniform spreading of urea and ammonium sulphate, and resulting sulphur deficiency are the cause. Although the fertilizers may be blended, they have different densities and may not spread evenly when mixed. The majority of acres are between flag leaf and early boot with some reaching heading growth stages. Other than a few fields with mildew, there are essentially no reports of diseases in the crop, so fungicide applications at the T2 timing may not be highly beneficial this year. The crop is moving quickly toward heading, and so far models are predicting low risk of Fusarium head blight.\\n\\nFigure 1. Sulfur deficiency in wheat. J. Follings, OMAFRA\\n\\nSpring cereals are generally at the 3 to 4 leaf growth stage with herbicide applications going on.Cereal leaf beetles (CLB) are reaching threshold levels at some locations, despite being quite small and still difficult to spot (Fig. 2). Control is warranted if an average of three larvae per tiller is found before boot stage. One CLB adult or larvae per stem warrants control after boot but prior to heading. If significant feeding is taking place on the flag leaf in the early heading stages, control may be warranted\\n\\nFigure 2. Cereal leaf beetle larva and feeding damage. T. Baute, OMAFRA\\n\\nForages\\n\\nForage producers in the southern half of the province have been busy harvesting the first cut of hay, but there are delays in the north and northwest. Rainy River is on track to harvest at the beginning of June. Cooler conditions in Thunder Bay District have delayed harvest by about a week and excessive moisture through Algoma District are resulting in a 2 to 3 week delay. Where there are delays, the grasses in hay mixtures are getting ahead of the alfalfa so there will be a difference in maturity at harvest.\\n\\nIn more southern regions the forage crop grew quickly and outpaced the alfalfa weevil larvae that were slow to develop. It is important to scout the regrowth after 1st cut as the weevil will start to reach the more damaging stages of 3rd and 4th instars. The characteristic symptom is the alfalfa plant not “greening up,” due to weevils feeding on the developing crown buds. The presence of two or more active larvae per crown, or 4–8 larvae per 30 cm by 30 cm (1 ft2) indicates a need to spray the stubble with insecticide. More information on alfalfa weevil is available in the Agronomy Guide for Field Crops at: http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/pub811/pub811ch15.pdf\\n\\nCanola\\n\\nSeeding of canola is essentially complete. There had been delays in northern regions because of late April snow and wet conditions. In Temiskaming District, most canola is yet to emerge or has just emerged, and most canola has emerged in West Nipissing. Earlier planted acres in Eastern Ontario and Bruce, Grey and Wellington counties is between the 1 and 4 leaf growth stages.\\n\\nFlea beetles have not been noted in the northern regions yet, but are present in many other canola growing regions. So far pressure appears to be low and seed treatments are holding flea beetle back. Insecticide applications should not be applied until at least 25% damage is observed. Once canola reaches the 4 leaf stage it is usually beyond economic damage.\\n\\nSwede midge have been observed in Elora and Shelburne, so growers should have pheromone traps in place and check them every few days. Refer to past articles on FieldCropNews.com for information on managing swede midge during early canola growth stages.\\n\\nDry Edible Beans\\n\\nPlanting of dry beans is approaching 25% complete. Most bean acres are on well-drained ground and there has been no risk of frost in the past week or more, so growers have taken the opportunity to get a bit of a head start. June 1st is typically the optimal planting time, but seeding into mid-June is acceptable. Ideally, adzuki beans should be planted by now as they take the longest to mature. Cranberry beans are the shortest season class of beans and can be planted into mid-June. Some fields are getting a bit dry; beans should be planted to moisture up to a maximum of 2.5 to 3 inches, otherwise wait for some rain. Regions that are expecting a storm should wait until after any pounding rain to plant so as to minimize issues with crusting.\\n\\nMay 23 – 29, 2018 Weather data\\n\\nSource : Field Crop News',\n",

       "     'text': 'By Rachel Purdy and Michael Langemeier\\n\\nCenter for Commercial Agriculture\\n\\nPurdue University\\n\\nExamining the competitiveness of wheat production in different regions of the world is often difficult due to lack of comparable data and consensus regarding what needs to be measured. To be useful, international data needs to be expressed in common production units and converted to a common currency. Also, production and cost measures need to be consistently defined across production regions or farms.\\n\\nThis paper examines the competitiveness of wheat production for important international wheat regions using 2013 to 2016 data from the agri benchmark network. Earlier work examined international benchmarks for the 2013 to 2015 period (farmdoc daily September 23, 2016). The agri benchmark network collects data on beef, cash crops, dairy, pigs and poultry, horticulture, and organic products. There are 38 countries represented in the cash crop network. The agri benchmark concept of typical farms was developed to understand and compare current farm production systems around the world. Participant countries follow a standard procedure to create typical farms that are representative of national farm output shares, and categorized by production system or combination of enterprises and structural features.\\n\\nThe sample of farms used in this paper was comprised of ten typical farms from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and United States. The farm and country abbreviations used in this paper are listed in table 1. Typical farms used in the agri benchmark network are defined using country initials and hectares on the farm. It is important to note that wheat enterprise data is collected from other countries. These seven countries represented in table 1 were selected to simplify the illustration of costs and discussion. There are three U.S. farms with wheat in the network. The U.S. farms used to illustrate wheat production in this paper is the western Kansas farm (US2025KS) and the southern Indiana farm (US1215INS).\\n\\nAll of the typical farms listed in table 1 produced multiple crops. The Argentine farm produced soybeans, corn, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The Australian farm produced barley, fodder, rapeseed, and summer wheat. The Canadian farm located in the Red River Valley produced barley, rapeseed, soybeans, summer wheat, and winter wheat. The Canadian farm located in Saskatchewan produced linseed, oats, peas, rapeseed, barley, and summer wheat. The German farm produced rapeseed, sugar beets, and winter wheat. The smaller Ukraine farm produced corn, rapeseed, soybeans, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The larger Ukraine farm produced corn, soybeans, sunflowers, and winter wheat. The southern Indiana farm produced corn, soybeans, and winter wheat. The production of winter wheat on the southern Indiana farm enables this farm to produce double-crop soybeans. The Kansas farm produced corn (both irrigated and non-irrigated) and winter wheat.\\n\\nWheat Yields\\n\\nAlthough yield is only a partial gauge of performance, it reflects the available production technology across farms. Average wheat yield for the farms in 2013 to 2016 was 66.8 bushels per acre (4.49 metric tons per hectare). Figure 1 illustrates average wheat yield per hectare for each typical farm. Average farm yields ranged from approximately 30.3 bushels per acre (2.04 metric tons per hectare) for the typical farm in Australia to 138.8 bushels per acre (9.33 metric tons per hectare) for the German farm. The Indiana farm had an average yield of 64.8 bushels per acre (4.36 metric tons per hectare) while the Kansas farm had an average yield of 40.6 bushels per acre (2.73 metric tons per hectare).\\n\\nInput Cost Shares\\n\\nDue to differences in technology adoption, input prices, fertility levels, efficiency of farm operators, trade policy restrictions, exchange rate effects, and labor and capital market constraints, input use varies across typical wheat farms. Figure 2 presents the average input cost shares for each farm. Cost shares were broken down into three major categories: direct costs, operating costs, and overhead costs. Direct costs included seed, fertilizer, crop protection, crop insurance, and interest on these cost items. Operating cost included labor, machinery depreciation and interest, fuel, and repairs. Overhead cost included land, building depreciation and interest, property taxes, general insurance, and miscellaneous cost.\\n\\nThe average input cost shares were 37.3 percent for direct cost, 37.4 percent for operating cost, and 25.4 percent for overhead cost. The Kansas farm had an above average cost share for direct cost at 40.1 percent, and a below average cost share for operating cost and overhead cost. Crop establishment costs are a large proportion of direct cost. The Indiana farm had an above average cost share for overhead cost at 45.3 percent and a below average cost share for direct costs and operating cost. The German farm also had a relatively high cost share for overhead cost. The relatively large cost share for overhead cost in Indiana and Germany largely reflects relatively high land costs. The Indiana farm had the smallest cost share for operating cost out of the sample analyzed at 18 percent.\\n\\nFigures 3 and 4 present seed, fertilizer, and pesticide cost per hectare and per ton for each of the typical farms. Compared to the U.S. farms, seed and fertilizer costs per hectare are relatively low in Australia. As noted above, the German farm had, by far, the highest yield per hectare. However, its establishment cost ($461 per hectare) is more than 80 percent above the average of the typical farms in the sample. Of the farms selected, the German farm had the highest seed, pesticide, and fertilizer costs per hectare. On a per hectare basis, the Indiana farm had the lowest pesticide cost, but this farm also had the highest seed cost. The Indiana farm’s pesticide costs were approximately 40 percent below the average.\\n\\nRevenue and Cost\\n\\nFigures 5 and 6 present average gross revenue and cost per hectare and per ton for each typical farm. Gross revenue and cost are reported as U.S. dollars per hectare and per ton. Wheat is a major enterprise on all of the typical farms presented in figures 5 and 6. It is obvious from figures 5 and 6 that gross revenue per hectare and per ton are substantially higher for the German farm. However, cost is also substantially higher for this farm. In fact, the German farm had the highest direct cost, operating cost, and overhead cost per hectare. However, on a per ton basis, the German farm had below average direct and operating cost, and above average overhead cost.\\n\\nThree of the selected typical farms had a negative economic profit during the 2013 to 2016 time period. Average losses for the typical farms from Argentina, Indiana, and Kansas were $57, $101, and $4 per acre, respectively during the four year period ($140, $249, $9 per hectare, respectively). The highest economic profit earned was $60 per acre ($148 per hectare) for the typical Russia farm. Despite having the lowest gross revenue per acre at $172 ($425 per hectare), the Australian farm had an average economic profit of $8 per acre ($20 per hectare) during the four-year period.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThis paper examined yield, gross revenue, and cost for farms with a wheat enterprise in the agri benchmark network from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and United States. Although the typical German farm had the highest yields, that farm also realized the highest seed, pesticide, and fertilizer costs per hectare. Both of the farms in the United States realized an economic loss during the 2013 to 2016 time period.',\n",

The news signals Japan’s continued confidence in Canada’s science-based regulatory system, following rigorous testing that confirmed there is no Genetically Modified (GM) wheat in Canadian shipments.\\n\\nJapan suspended imports on June 15 following the discovery of less than 10 GM wheat plants growing along an oil well access road in Southern Alberta. Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) inspections confirmed shortly after that this was an isolated incident. Ongoing monitoring by the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) has found no evidence that unapproved wheat has entered export cargos. GM wheat is not authorized to be grown commercially in any country.\\n\\n“Today’s news proves that Canada’s science-based regulatory system works,” said Tom Steve, AWC General Manager. “Not only does Canada’s grain handling system employ some of the most rigorous quality control protocols in the world, but we also prioritize transparency with our customers. Japan is a highly valued customer of Canada and we are pleased to see that they have reaffirmed their confidence in our system and have resumed normal trade.”\\n\\nAWC commends the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) for their continued management of Canada’s regulatory and quality control systems.\\n\\nSource : Alberta Wheat Commission',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Jonathan Kleinjan\\n\\nWheat yields are determined by the combination of main stem, and tillers. A tiller is a stem or shoot produced after the initial parent shoot grows from the wheat seed. Opinions vary as to whether or not more tillers are beneficial to grain yields. Tillers can be beneficial, helping a wheat plant to ‘fill-in’ areas with a poor stand and thus provide weed suppression. More tillers can also result in more heads at harvest, although most research has shown that, regardless of the number of tillers produced, 85-100% of HRSW grain yield is produced by the main stem and the T1 and T2 tillers. A review of intensive wheat management studies suggest that increased yields are the result of more primary spikes with heavier kernels, instead of increased tiller counts.\\n\\nIf a producer wishes to reduce the number of tillers in a wheat production field, there are several management practices which can be implemented.\\n\\n1. Delayed planting.\\n\\nLate planting will generally result in fewer tillers due to a reduction in vegetative growth. However, wheat is a cool-season grass and is most productive when planted early. This management practice is not recommended.\\n\\n2. Variety selection.\\n\\nThere is genotypic variation for tillering capacity among cultivars. While environmental factors are typically more important than variety selection, low-tillering varieties may respond differently to other management practices than high-tillering varieties.\\n\\n3. Nitrogen rate and timing.\\n\\nIn general, more N will result in more vegetative growth and more tillers. However, tiller formation can be affected by the timing of N and can be increased when application occurs before planting or during the tillering process. To reduce tillers, the bulk of N should be applied after tillering, just prior to stem elongation. A drawback to this approach is another trip across the field and the risk of having N application delayed by weather events.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Forecast 2018/19 U.S. wheat production is raised 54 million bushels to 1,881 million. The NASS July Crop Production report provides survey-based production forecasts for all wheat classes for the first time in the 2018/19 crop year. The production forecast for durum and other spring wheat are up from last year’s low level due to improved yields and higher spring wheat area. Winter wheat production is down slightly from the June forecast. Ending stocks for 2018/19 are raised 39 million bushels this month but are 11 percent below last year’s revised stocks. The 2018/19 season-average farm price is lowered $0.10 per bushel at the midpoint to a projected range of $4.50 to $5.50.\\n\\nForeign 2018/19 wheat supplies are decreased 9.3 million tons primarily on lower production, which is the smallest in three years. The production declines are led by a 4.4-million-ton reduction for the EU reflecting continued dryness especially in the north. Australia, Russia, and Ukraine are lowered 2.0 million, 1.5 million, and 1.0 million tons, respectively, and also reflect continued dryness. China production is reduced 1.0 million tons on lower harvested area as reported by the Ministry of Agriculture. Global 2018/19 exports are lowered 1.9 million tons on decreased supplies. EU exports are reduced 1.5 million tons and Australia and Russia are both lowered 1.0 million tons. These export reductions are partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Canada and a 0.7-million-ton increase for the United States. Total foreign consumption for 2018/19 is lowered 2.3 million tons on both lower food and feed and residual use. With global supplies declining more than projected use, world ending stocks are reduced 5.3 million tons to 260.9 million.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

       "     'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy John Schlageck, Kansas Farm Bureau\\n\\n\\n\\n“Better than expected, but not what we’d hoped for.”\\n\\nThis is what I heard when I asked Kansas farmers about this year’s wheat harvest. Still, with the little moisture received during the growing season, the 2018 wheat crop panned out better than most Kansas farmers thought it would.\\n\\nSteve Boor, Lincoln County farmer wrapped up harvest June 30, two weeks after he began. The 2018 wheat harvest dragged on longer than usual because of the pesky showers that dropped a few hundredths of rain then disappeared. The rain resulted in harvest delays as Boor and other farmers waited for the crop to dry out.\\n\\nIn addition to the holdups, the veteran Lincoln County wheat producer says the quality varied, the yields varied – everything varied. The wheat looked much better going into the (combine) header than it did going into the bin.\\n\\n“Just spots, spots and more spots,” Boor says. “We’d be cutting along and go through a thin spot and ask, ‘what happened here?’ It obviously wasn’t the drill, it wasn’t the sprayer – it just amazed me that a field of wheat could go from little, if any wheat to good, thick wheat so quickly.”\\n\\nOne of the challenges harvesters face in thin wheat is traveling fast enough to keep a steady mat of crop flowing through the combine. This is necessary to utilize the machine’s large threshing capacity.\\n\\nTraveling at faster speeds to ensure efficient threshing sometimes presents its own inconveniences.\\n\\n“Hitting a good-sized badger hole at those speeds can certainly jar your teeth,” Boor says.\\n\\nAnother sign of a stressed crop this harvest included a small percentage of stalks lodged too close to the ground to recover. Some instances of broken stalks showed up throughout this year's harvest.\\n\\nWheat protein levels on the Lincoln County crop will likely range from the upper 12s to the lower 13s. Yields varied from approximately 50 bushels-per-acre on the river bottom ground in widely isolated small patches to the mid-30s on much of the 2018 crop.\\n\\n“I’m sure the wheat lightened up a bit the longer we cut,” Boor says. “Still, I’m hoping the test weight hung tough at least about 59 pounds-per-bushel.”\\n\\nAmazingly enough, this year’s wheat crop demonstrated its ever-enduring properties. It proved once again, wheat needs timely moisture to produce an abundant crop.\\n\\nDuring the early period of the growing season after the first of the year, Boor wouldn’t have bet a “plug nickel” on even harvesting this year’s crop considering the lack of snow and rain.\\n\\n“You cannot fault the wheat for not yielding more,” he says. “The crop just played the hand it was dealt and did the best it could.”\\n\\nAfter talking with neighbors and other producers across Kansas, Boor believes the crop he harvested is like many others across the state.\\n\\n“I didn’t see anyone tearing up the roads with trucks hauling wheat to the elevators,” he says. “I have yet to hear anyone pounding their chest and saying, ‘Look what we cut.’”\\n\\nNeedless to say, there probably will not be much double cropping beans behind this harvested wheat crop. With the lack of moisture in most places of the state, farmers aren’t ready to gamble on a second crop.\\n\\nThe Lincoln County farmer remains optimistic the fall crops will benefit from some timely rains. This would move the milo and beans a long way down the road to a better fall harvest.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to see more...\",\n",

These trials illustrate the company’s continued commitment to be a leader in vegetable seed research and development. In Naples, seed resellers and growers had the opportunity to see, touch and taste new and experimental varieties and hear about the benefits these introductions will bring to the market.\\n\\n“These events provide a crucial opportunity for us to interact with growers and shape our breeding strategies based on their feedback and personal experience,” said Javier Martinez-Cabrera, head of vegetable seeds for Syngenta, North America. “We’re proud to offer growers the best genetics that can help them meet market needs and address local production challenges.”\\n\\nThe Naples event is the first in a series over the course of the summer. Additional events will take place in Woodland and Gilroy, California; Plainfield, Wisconsin; Pasco, Washington; Hall, New York; and Stanton, Minnesota.\\n\\nThe following summary provides a snapshot of standout varieties and innovative solutions featured at the Naples event. Attendees at future events will experience some of these varieties, as well as others specifically tailored to meet local production challenges and market needs.\\n\\nBean\\n\\nTwo new bean varieties, Outlaw and Desperado, showed great seed quality and early maturity at the Naples station. Desperado matures three days early, helping growers get to market sooner. Outlaw features a straight bean with great holding and low risk of lodging.\\n\\n“Historically our bean varieties have been known for stress tolerance and pod marketability,” said Andrew Bryan, product manager, fresh large-seeded vegetables (LSV) at Syngenta. “Increased yield and seed quality are also top priorities for our breeding department, and we are showing that with our current new product introductions.”\\n\\nMelon\\n\\nAthena has been available for 25 years and sets the industry standard for eastern shipper varieties. Accolade is an evolution of Athena’s heritage to meet specific needs in the market. Another eastern shipper variety, Astound, also provides growers with great internal fruit quality and flesh firmness for extended shelf life.\\n\\n“Our melon program has been a reliable source of high-quality melon varieties for growers for decades,” said Bert Stoddard, product manager, melon and squash, at Syngenta. “We’re excited about the opportunities our newest introductions bring to continue this tradition.”\\n\\nPepper\\n\\nOutsider was a highlight at Naples, performing well even under stressful conditions. Outsider is a two-pick pepper, with some locations seeing continuous picking conditions.\\n\\n“Growers are always seeking market versatility,” said Rachel Broadbent, product manager, pepper and tomato, at Syngenta. “Varieties featured at Naples like Outsider and Standout offer opportunities for both field pack and place pack markets.”\\n\\nSquash\\n\\nGrandprize squash and Everglade zucchini were new introductions featured in the trial. A direct upgrade from Envy, Everglade produces higher yields and offers improved flavor for consumers. “Grandprize directly addresses the needs we’ve heard from growers in the field,” said Stoddard.\\n\\nSweet Corn\\n\\nSeveral sweet corn varieties were featured at the Naples trial event, including Attribute® II offerings with tolerance to glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides for greater flexibility in weed management.\\n\\n“Growers are always looking for ways to improve production convenience and efficiency,” said Bryan. “With features like the Attribute II trait stack and a variety of endosperm types, we are creating new opportunities for growers to produce high-quality using the same weed control program they are currently applying to their field corn acres.”\\n\\nTomato\\n\\nAttendees were able to see a number of tomato varieties that offer flexibility for multiple planting slots, including a new, mature green variety Varsity. Varsity is well-suited for the Florida and Georgia markets with strong disease resistance to TYLCV, TSWV and Fusarium crown rot. This resistance stack is coupled with strong yield performance to help increase potential return on investment. To broaden its strong portfolio, Syngenta is also breeding new varieties for the hot-set market.\\n\\n“We’re excited to be re-entering the hot-set market and are actively trialing varieties with TYLCV resistance coupled with hot-setting ability,” Broadbent said.\\n\\nWatermelon\\n\\nSome of our newest experimental varieties shown at the trial featured Fusarium race 2 tolerance plus stronger vines for full season harvesting versatility. Varieties currently available, including Melody and Excursion, also performed well under high-stress conditions at the Naples station.\\n\\n“We were happy to see good performance in the field, and think the best is yet to come for our watermelon program,” said Jose Cabrera, product manager, watermelon, at Syngenta.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Beth K. Gugino\\n\\nDowny mildew lesions on the upper surface of a cantaloupe leaf.\\n\\nNo new reports of late blight since the confirmations on tomato in York County and on potato and tomato in southern Lancaster County a couple of weeks ago.\\n\\nIf you suspect late blight, please contact your local Penn State Extension office or let Beth Gugino know via email at bkgugino@psu.edu or by phone at 814-865-7328. For the latest reports check USBlight.org.\\n\\nCucurbit Downy Mildew: Recent Weather Favored Disease Spread\\n\\nThe recent unsettled weather pattern that generated severe storms across some parts of the state put much of the central and eastern Pennsylvania at high risk for downy mildew spread and disease development. This was primarily from inoculum sources in the mid-Atlantic region. However, on Monday (July 16) downy mildew was confirmed in a cucumber field a couple of counties south of Richmond, VA. This report bridges the gap between the reports further south along the east coast and those on the Delmarva Peninsula. Depending on environmental conditions symptoms from these most recent events will become visible and produce spores in as few as 4 to 12 days. So continued scouting over the next week is critical. Downy mildew specific fungicides are recommended for both cucumber and cantaloupe. The pathotypes that infect these crops are very similar, and in our region, we typically confirm downy mildew first on cucumber and then shortly after on cantaloupe. Ideal downy mildew weather for spore production includes temperatures between 50 and 68°F and free moisture from heavy dew, rain or high relative humidity for 6 to 12 hours.\\n\\nStatewide downy mildew has only been reported to-date on cucumber in Mifflin County There have been no reports of downy mildew on jack-o-lantern type pumpkin in the eastern US. Protectant fungicides that are being tank mixed for the management of powdery mildew will also help protect against downy mildew. At this time, the closest reports on butternut squash are in North and South Carolina. See previous updates for specific management recommendations.\\n\\nIf you suspect cucurbit downy mildew on your farm, please contact your local Penn State Extension Office or let Beth Gugino know via email at bkgugino@psu.edu or by phone at 814-865-7328. Every confirmed report of downy mildew enables us to improve disease forecasting accuracy for the benefit of cucurbit growers not only in Pennsylvania but all along the east coast. Even reports made from previously reported counties. The latest information on reports of cucurbit downy mildew can be found at the CDM ipmPIPE website\\n\\nHave you seen any viral diseases in tomato?\\n\\nThere have been several reports of viruses or virus-like symptoms in tomato and more specifically high tunnel tomato. Symptoms of viruses range from bronzing, mottling (light/dark green areas), and necrosis of the leaves to severe leaf distortion (e.g., shoestring) and stunting of the plant. Often it is difficult to identify viruses simply based on symptoms and submitting samples for further diagnostics is often recommended. The Penn State Plant Disease Clinic can routinely check for tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and tomato/tobacco mosaic virus (ToMV/TMV). Typically once symptoms are observed there is not much that can be done regarding management aside from potentially rogueing the symptomatic plants to prevent further spread. However, identifying the causal virus can help inform management strategies next season. Keep in mind, that herbicide injury can also cause symptoms similar to those of viruses and that there are over 20 viruses that affect tomato so submitting a sample to a diagnostic lab such as Agdia may be necessary.\\n\\nSubtle mottling caused by tobacco/tomato mosaic virus (ToMV/TMV) on tomato.\\n\\nBronzing caused by tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) on tomato.\\n\\nMany viruses are vectored by insects, so management needs to be focused on the insect rather than the virus. Thrips, more specifically the western flower thrips and tobacco thrips are the primary vectors of TSWV. This virus is characterized by bronzing on the leaf surface, possible stunting of the plants and chlorotic/yellowish rings on fruit if infected later in the season. Another example is CMV which is vectored by more than 75 different aphid species. The most distinct symptom is the “shoestring” strapping of the leaves. That being said, there are also viruses that are transmitted (or moved around) mechanically on people’s hands, clothing or tools. An example of a mechanically transmitted virus would be ToMV/TMV. Washing hands frequently with soap and water and consider disinfesting tools regularly with 20% nonfat dry milk solution to denature the virus particles.\\n\\nShoestring leaf distortion caused by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) on tomato.',\n",

As the company’s variety development coordinator, he is looking for potatoes with unique characteristics, such as shape, color, size – “anything that might improve what we already grow and put in our bag for our customers.”\\n\\nTasteful Selections concentrates mainly on baby potatoes, a rapidly growing market, he said. This is his fourth year to come observe the trials in Springlake, but he has been growing and evaluating Texas A&M potatoes for seven years in California and at other Tasteful Selections growing regions on the West Coast. They currently have three Texas experimental varieties in their advanced trials.\\n\\n“If the varieties pass all the qualifications in early observation trials, we will get then graduate the lines into replicated and commercial tests,” Kuball said.\\n\\nKuball was among about 50 people who attended the annual Potato Field Day in cooperation with Springlake Potato Sales Inc. and the Bruce Barrett Farm.\\n\\nDr. Isabel Vales, Texas A&M AgriLife Research potato breeder in College Station, said the breeding program’s main goal is to develop new potato varieties. She now leads the breeding program, long run by Dr. Creighton Miller.\\n\\n“We work in different market classes,” Vales said. “Clearly the fresh market russets are very important, followed by the chippers.”\\n\\nThe Texas A&M program is known for its release of several strains of the fresh-market Russet Norkotah strains, including No. 278, which she said is “a beautiful fresh market russet, long appreciated in the marketplace.” The Texas A&M Russet Norkotah strains currently have 35 licensees in 12 states. Another recent release, Reveille Russet, has been licensed to 16 seed growers, with comments that it is “a very good baking potato.”\\n\\nRusset stars of the Texas A&M potato breeding program, from left to right: an unnamed specialty variety with pink eyes; Vanguard, being released this year; Reveille, released in 2015; and the long-standing Norkotah.\\n\\n“Vanguard Russet is our latest release,” Vales said. “It is a blocky, attractive potato that we have great hopes for. We also have another russet variety with pink eyes and yellow flesh, but we are still in the process of finding someone interested in promoting it.”\\n\\nIn terms of specialty potatoes, she said they are working with varieties that provide different sizes, colors of skin and flesh, as well as some with higher levels of antioxidants.\\n\\n“We are working in the area of smaller potatoes, bite-sized potatoes, but that’s a relatively new market, and we need promoters or ambassadors who are interested in moving those potatoes to the public,” Vales said. “We also have some pretty advanced materials, not quite ready to be released, but very interesting from the perspective of different culinary preparations.”\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

We have placed 4 traps with commercial SWD lures at each site. Use these results in addition to your own monitoring program to determine when SWD is present on your farm. Conduct a salt water test or a plastic baggie test to confirm presence of larvae in fruit.\\n\\nThe monitoring project is a collaboration among the Niagara Peninsula Fruit and Vegetable Growers, Ontario Tender Fruit Growers, the Eastern Ontario Berry Growers, OMAFRA staff and private consultants.\\n\\nSWD has been identified in traps in Essex, Chatham-Kent, Elgin, Niagara, Wellington, Durham and Norfolk counties as of July 13. Numbers are starting to increase- note the wild host catches in Elgin County. This means that growers with ripening crops susceptible to SWD should consider using a product with activity against swd in preharvest sprays. Check the SWD product registrations on our website.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Victor Shelton\\n\\nThis paddock may look messy, but what looks like a weed is actually a fantastic, highly nutritious native legume, tick foil (Desmodium).\\n\\nI certainly didn’t expect the blessed amount of rain that has fallen on most of Indiana in the last month. In some areas, the amount could be considered more of a curse than blessing, especially on cropland. It certainly has made making dry hay a challenge. I am still happy to have the moisture.\\n\\nMy pasture was getting fairly dry before the rains started; dry enough that growth was slowing down. I had already slowed down the speed of the livestock to allow a little extra rest and now I have picked up momentium again. I’m delighted to see good regrowth of forage in paddocks not far behind where livestock had just been.\\n\\nWith more vegetation now and new growth still coming, it is not hard to maintain excellent cover and let the livestock take the best and leave and/or trample the rest. Measured soil temperatures under these conditions have been very good, usually in the upper 70’s at two inches of depth. This amazes me, especially with some of the extremely hot weather we have had lately. This temperature is very important. At soil temperatures in the 70’s, 100% of moisture is usable for plant growth. Highly disturbed pastures or overgrazed thin pastures usually have higher soil temperatures. If those temperatures reach 95-100 degrees, only about 15% of the moisture is now able to be utilized for plant growth, the rest is lost through evaporation and transpiration. It is not difficult to maintain cover and optimize all the vegetative growth and production we can get; just don’t get behind the eight ball.\\n\\nJust a side note, cooler soil temperatures are enjoyed by the grazing livestock too. Some people get pretty serious about having shade for animals during hot weather. Shade certainly has benefits, especially when temperatures and humidity are both over 85. But, a cool water source close at hand and cool soil that’s being maintained by good ground cover also plays a very important part. Animals in pastures with good forage, cool soils and cool water at hand tend to lay down in the field more and don’t seek shade as much, even when available. The ground can be very cooling. Grazing livestock like water that ranges from about 37 degrees to 65 degrees. Doesn’t that sound like temperatures two legged critters like too? Most spring, well, and even a lot of municipal water is around 50-54 degrees.\\n\\nBy maintaining ground cover and the vegetative solar panel, with adequate moisture, production should be very good with the only other two main contributing factors being fertility and management. If grazing livestock are managed where they are moved to fresh forage on a regular basis and not allowed to continuously graze or take multiple bites on the same plant before being moved forward, maintaining cover is not difficult at all. They don’t have to be moved everyday, but the more often they are given new fresh forage, the more content they will be and also the less likely they will overgraze individual plants.\\n\\nI’m a huge fan of utilizing long, fairly narrow, linear fields for pasture and using temporary fence to allocate new forage to the livestock. Generally, especially when new growth is limited, I recommend to use a back fence to prevent livestock from going back and regrazing forages that need to be resting for later use. With adequate amounts of forage to work with, especially when new allocations are higher in quality than where the livestock have just eaten, stepped, or soiled, backgrazing is very limited as long as you keep them moving forward in a timely manner. If you don’t move them quick enough and they run out of fresh forage, they will go back and take a second or third bite and/or graze regrowth which will retard future growth and grazing. This kind of system is very feasible and workable on fields where water is not readily available across the field. As long as the walking distance isn’t too far, generally no more than 1,200 feet, AND they are not in the field more than seven to ten days, this progressive forward moving will prevent most problems. Longer grazing periods or walking distances will promote backgrazing, trailing and movement of nutrients from outer reaches being grazed closer to the water source.\\n\\nIf you have any warm season grasses and you haven’t already started grazing them, now is good time to start. Most people tend to wait too long. These warm season forages can include swichgrass, big bluestem and Indiangrass. Switchgrass comes on the earliest, almost too early here in the Midwest because it is ready to graze about the same time cool season forages are also at peak. It can be taken as hay and then grazed later in July or August. You don’t want switchgrass to mature because quality will drop quickly. The same thing is pretty much true for big bluestem and Indiangrass. The best grazing and quality will be in the vegetative stage. If you’ve not started grazing it yet and see the beginnings of any seed heads, it is time to start. Big bluestem and Indiangrass should be 24 to 30 inches tall prior to grazing and then grazed ideally no shorter than about 12-15 inches. At these stop grazing heights, they will rebound quickly and provide a lot more growth. If taken down short, they will take longer to grow back. They rarely should be taken down less than six inches. These warm season forages absolutely love this weather we have been having. When grazing these forages, all of the cool season forages get a break and continue to grow to provide future grazing. As I’ve said many times before, more grazing days means less inputs and less work; remember, the cows are supposed to be working for you, not you for them!\\n\\nLastly, I want to talk about clipping just a bit. Everyone thinks that clipping pastures is always needed. I hear all kinds of reasons and some are valid. Weed control is certainly a good reason. The threshold for weed control is usually when weeds are reaching 30% canopy. At 30% canopy, weeds are blocking enough sunlight to really start impacting production. A noxious weed threshold is a lot less. Removal of seedheads is the next reason I hear and generally with the fear of pinkeye. It does take three constituents for pinkeye; a host cow, which often is a silent carrier, an irritant which could be a seedhead or dust creating watery eyes, and flies to transport it from the carrier to non-resistant animals. Lastly, and probably the most common reason is aesthetics. I have to admit that a nicely mowed pasture does look good, but more often than not, we are not able to clip high enough to not remove forage that could have been grazed. If vegetation is very heavy, a lot of that clipped vegetation ends up laying on top blocking sunlight and retarding growth. In forage studies, when I weighted before and after grazing on both unclipped and clipped, cows removed more from the unclipped than clipped meaning we not only were spending money where perhaps not needed, but we may have lost some grazing days too. Some things still just make me stop and scratch my head.',\n",

Every time contaminated water comes in direct contact with fruit or vegetables, there is a risk that these pathogens may be transferred to the produce.\\n\\nRegulation 119/11 section 4 states that you cannot harvest, pack, sell or transport contaminated produce. Every effort should be made to prevent contamination of produce with pathogens to ensure the safety of consumers.\\n\\nWater used for irrigation should comply with the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines\\n\\nFecal coliforms ( coli) : Fewer than 100 bacteria per 100 mL water\\n\\nTotal coliforms: Fewer than 1,000 bacteria per 100 mL water\\n\\nSource: Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment November 2008\\n\\nHigh generic E. coli counts can occur in any water supply including streams, canals, ponds and lakes. This bacteria has been observed to survive for days to almost a year in soil, manure and water habitats. Rain events can cause significant spikes in E. coli levels. High levels of E. coli in irrigation water are a concern as they indicate fecal contamination, and may be a sign that pathogens are present. Examples of pathogens include Salmonella spp., the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) such as E. coli 0157:H7, Campylobacter and parasites such as Cryptosporidium parvum.\\n\\nConservation Authorities have been monitoring water quality and producing watershed report cards since 2012. Many monitoring sites showed average E. coli levels above the recommended guideline. Contact your local Conservation Authority for data in your area.\\n\\nFood safety programs often include the requirement of assessing the quality of your irrigation water. Taking water samples at your pumping location for microbial testing is a good way to get a better idea of what’s in your water.\\n\\nReady-to-eat produce, which is not cooked before eating, poses a higher food safety risk, and requires extra precaution during production. If your irrigation water is variable, or poses higher risk due to the presence of E. coli, mitigation strategies must be considered to reduce the risk.\\n\\nSo what options are available to growers if they have variable or high risk water due to the presence of E. coli?\\n\\nUse a form of irrigation where the water will not directly contact the fruit i.e. drip irrigation or micro sprinklers (under tree). Choose a different water source which meets the Guideline e.g. a well or municipal supply. Treat water to improve its quality and meet the Guideline.\\n\\nThe U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), Produce Safety Rule states that it is possible to reduce food safety risks from poor quality irrigation water by establishing a waiting period between the irrigation and harvest. This waiting period is known as the post-harvest interval, or PHI. In the U.S., growers are provided the guidance that E. coli die off will occur at a rate of 1 log for every 2 days. 1 log is equal to a reduction to 10% of the original value. A 2-day PHI will reduce bacterial load to 10% of its original value. A 4-day PHI will reduce bacterial load to 1% of its original value.\\n\\nThis guidance extends to a maximum reduction of E. coli to 1% of its original value. However, the rate at which die off occurs is not guaranteed. Also, the rate at which other pathogens die off, may or may not be the same as E. coli, for example Cryptosporidium oocysts may also be present in the contaminated water and can survive longer. As a result, it is impossible to predict how long growers must wait after irrigating with contaminated water to ensure the crops are not contaminated.\\n\\nStudies have shown that E. coli can survive more than 25 days on lettuce. The recent E. coli outbreak in romaine lettuce has been tied to tainted Arizona irrigation canal water. This E. coli outbreak has killed one person, sent 75 people to hospital, and sickened 172 people across 30 states. The outbreak has resulted in a significant economic impact to the romaine lettuce industry with a 45% reduction of sales in May, and prices for whole heads of romaine lettuce down 60%.\\n\\nContamination of a food product can have wide-ranging and damaging implications for an entire industry. The best way to ensure food safety is to prevent pathogens from coming into contact with crops.\\n\\nAdditional information on sampling irrigation water for food safety and interpreting the results can be found at: http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/food/foodsafety/foodsafetyprograms.htm\\n\\nSource : ONfruit',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Richard Jauron\\n\\nTomatoes are the most popular vegetable crop in Iowa - popular with gardeners, green caterpillars and growing season plant diseases. Iowa State University Extension and Outreach horticulturists describe the symptoms and management of common problems found in home gardens. For more information, contact the ISU Hortline at 515-294-3108 or hortline@iastate.edu.\\n\\nThere are large, green caterpillars on my tomato plants. What should I do?\\n\\nThe large, green caterpillars are probably tomato hornworms. Tomato hornworms are bright green, up to 4 to 5 inches long, and have red or black, horn-like projections on their rear ends. After feeding, hornworms move to the soil where they pupate and spend the winter. The following summer the pupae transform into five-spotted hawk moths and repeat the cycle.\\n\\nTomato hornworms feed on the leaves and fruit of tomatoes and other vegetables including eggplant, potatoes and peppers. They can quickly defoliate portions of the plant and damage the fruit.\\n\\nOften the best control option for home gardeners is to pick off the caterpillars by hand and destroy them. Finding them can be challenging, especially when they’re small, as they are well camouflaged. Another control option is to use a biological insecticide, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or a synthetic home garden insecticide.\\n\\nBrownish black spots have developed on the bottoms of some of my tomato fruit. What is the problem?\\n\\nBlossom end rot is probably responsible for the brownish black spots on the tomato fruit. Blossom end rot is a common problem on tomatoes. It appears as a brownish black spot on the blossom end (bottom) of fruit. Secondary organisms invade the brownish black spot and cause the fruit to rot. Blossom end rot is most common on the earliest maturing fruit that ripen in July and early August.\\n\\nBlossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency in the developing fruit. Wide fluctuations in soil moisture levels impair calcium uptake by the root system of the tomato plant. Excessive nitrogen fertilization may also contribute to blossom end rot.\\n\\nTo reduce blossom end rot, water tomato plants on a weekly basis during dry weather to provide a consistent supply of moisture to the plants. (Tomato plants need 1 inch of water per week during the growing season.) Mulch the area around the tomato plants to conserve soil moisture. Avoid over-fertilization. There is no need to apply calcium to the soil, as most garden soils contain adequate levels of calcium.\\n\\nPick and discard fruit affected with blossom end rot. The removal of the affected fruit will allow the tomato plant to channel all of its resources into the growth and development of the remaining fruit.\\n\\nBlossom end rot also can occur on pepper, eggplant, summer squash and watermelon.',\n",

Downy mildew symptoms on sunflower seedling.\\n\\nAs is the case every year there is a possibility that we may see some downy mildew in young sunflower fields around the state in 2018. Downy mildew is often found at low levels in fields. Prevalence and incidence of this disease will vary from year to year as environmental conditions do impact the incidence of this disease. Cool, wet soil conditions and heavy dews are conducive to development of the disease.\\n\\nDowny mildew of sunflowers is indigenous to South Dakota and is capable of infecting all wild sunflower species. This disease is soil borne and can survive for many years in the soil. Seedlings are only susceptible to the disease for a limited time early in their lifecycle. Wet, low areas in a field are often areas the disease can be found. In rare occurrences the disease can be seed borne. When this occurs, again rarely, the disease will impact a larger area of the field.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nPlanting genetically resistant hybrids and the use of fungicide seed treatments has been the most common method of managing this disease. However, some fungicide resistance (FRAC 4 chemistry) has been identified. Systemic infections, or infection of seedlings through the roots causes the most serious losses. Symptoms include stunting, leaf chlorosis, white sporulation on the underside of the leaf and eventually plant death. Mature plants will be stunted and heads will be horizontal at maturity. Secondary infections result in little to no yield loss and can be identified by discrete chlorotic leaf spots on upper leaf surface.\\n\\nClick here to see more...',\n",

Gugino\\n\\nSeptoria leaf spot on tomato\\n\\nThe general shift to drier weather has slowed down disease development across the state.\\n\\nThis past week there have been additional reports of downy mildew on cucumber on the Delmarva Peninsula in Kent County, Delaware and Wicomico County, Maryland. Current weather patterns do not indicate movement into our region. However, regular scouting, especially in southeastern Pennsylvania, is important. No new reports of late blight since the confirmations on tomato in York County and on potato and tomato in southern Lancaster County last week. Blackleg on potatoes continues to be a problem in some parts of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nCommon Mid-Summer Tomato Diseases\\n\\nEarly Blight and Septoria Leaf Spot\\n\\nEarly blight and Septoria leaf spot are two fungal diseases commonly seen in tomato fields as the plants start to fruit. Both start on the lower leaves when spores are splash-dispersed during rain events and work their way up the plant leading to defoliation. Early blight lesions are initially small, brown to black, and may be surrounded by a yellow halo. As the disease progresses, larger lesions will develop a characteristic concentric ring pattern. Lesions with concentric ring patterns can also develop on the fruit and stems. Septoria lesions are circular with a tan center surrounded by a darker margin/border. With the aid of a hand lens, small black pycnidia (spore producing structures) can be seen in the center of the lesions. The lesions primarily develop on the leaves and not the fruit or stems. Both pathogens survive on crop residue, so shorter rotations lead to increased problems. Although early blight is favored by slightly warmer temperatures (75 to 85°F) and Septoria cooler temperatures (68 to 77°F), it is not uncommon to see both at the same time. In recent years however growers and other stakeholders have commented on the increasing predominance of Septoria leaf spot in tomato fields.\\n\\nSmall round lesions, a darker margin, and tan center are characteristic of Septoria leaf spot on tomato. Small dark pycnidia can be seen in the center of the lesions in this enlarged image.\\n\\nEarly blight lesion with concentric rings and characteristic yellowing.\\n\\nDuring the season, maximizing air flow by suckering, staking and tying the plants as well as minimizing working the field when it is wet will help minimize spread. Mulching around plants to reduce soil splash may also help. Protectant fungicides like chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and Gavel will also help reduce spread, but good coverage is important. These are best rotated with products in FRAC codes 3, 7 or 11 including Quadris Top (FRAC 3 + 11), Revus Top (FRAC 3 + 40), Endura and Fontelis (FRAC 7), Priaxor (FRAC 7 + 11), etc. See the 2018 Mid-Atlantic Commercial Vegetable Production Recommendationsfor a more complete list of recommendations.\\n\\nFor organic production, copper-based products (e.g., Champ, Nordox, Badge X2) could be used in a program with plant defense activator products (e.g., Regalia) and microbial biopesticides (e.g., Double Nickel, Serenade, etc.). As with most product, these are best used preventatively. With funding support from the Pennsylvania Vegetable Growers Association and PA Marketing and Research Board this summer, the vegetable pathology program at Penn State is evaluating the integration of biopesticides into conventional programs coupled with host resistance for the management of early blight and Septoria leaf spot on tomato.',\n",

       "     'text': \"By Todd Hubbs\\n\\nDepartment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics\\n\\nUniversity of Illinois\\n\\nSoybean prices continued to move lower last week as trade issues and a strong start to the growing season continue to pressure prices. At this time, very little positive news is entering the market to support soybean prices on either the supply or demand side. The potential size of the soybean crop and trade uncertainty continue to be the main forces behind soybean price weakness.\\n\\nSlight changes may be forthcoming for 2017-18 marketing year demand estimates in the June WASDE report. Soybean crush continued at a robust pace through the second half of the marketing year. April crush estimates by USDA came in at 172 million bushels. Current USDA estimates of crush during this marketing year total 1.365 billion bushels, six percent above last year's total over the same period. The current pace implies that the crush during the remaining four months of the year must total 625 million bushels, two percent higher than the crush of a year ago over the last four months, to reach the USDA projection of 1.99 billion bushels. Argentinian production is set to come in lower than the current USDA forecast of 1.43 billion bushels and provide some support to domestic crush. Soybean crush shows no signs of weakening this summer in the U.S. and a slight upward adjustment may occur to the domestic crush total in the WASDE report.\\n\\nSoybean exports currently meet the pace needed to meet the projection of 2.065 billion bushels for the 2017-18 marketing year. As of June 7, soybean export inspections total 1.744 billion bushels. Cumulative Census Bureau export estimates from September 2017 through April 2018 exceeded weekly export inspections by 42 million bushels. If the same margin exhibited at the end of March continued through this period, exports through June 7 equaled 1.786 billion bushels. With 12 weeks remaining in the marketing year, 23.3 million bushels per week are necessary to meet the USDA projection. Over the last six weeks, soybean export inspections averaged 24 million bushels per week but varied with a low of 19.6 million bushels on for the week ending May 3 and a high of 33.3 million bushels for the week ending May 17. As of May 31, 332 million bushels of soybean had been sold for export but not shipped. This number exceeds the 279 million bushels necessary to reach 2.065 billion bushels based off of current sales figures and estimated export levels through May 31. USDA estimates of soybean exports appear unlikely to be adjusted for this marketing year, but the potential exists for the USDA to lower 2018-19 marketing year export forecast. Trade issues and a slight increase to Brazilian crop production place the current 2.29 billion bushel projection in question.\\n\\nWhile the current marketing year holds some information about price development, soybean production associated with the next marketing year may provide a more significant impact over the next month. The potential for a large soybean crop is placing pressure on prices currently. Initial concerns about the 2018 soybean crop related to planting seem a distant memory as the early season crop condition report put soybean crops in good or excellent condition at 75 percent, the highest level since 2010. Recent weather developments in the Corn Belt provide no indication of deterioration in crop conditions over the next few weeks. Historically, there is very little correlation between final soybean yield and early season crop condition reports. Summer weather will determine yield, but the current weather looks promising for a large crop. While some dry areas developed over the last few weeks, approximately 10 percent of U.S. soybean acres sit in a moderate drought as of June 5. The 8 - 14 day weather forecast provided by NOAA Climate Prediction Center shows above normal precipitation and warming temperatures over much of the Corn Belt.\\n\\nWhile yield looks promising, soybean acreage is still in question. Soybean planted acreage, as of June 3, came in at 83 percent well ahead of the five-year average of 75 percent. A slow start to the planting season held out the possibility of acreage changes, particularly in the northern Plains. Currently, there is no indication of major acreage changes due to planting issues in the Corn Belt. Since 1997, the average change from the March Prospective Planting report to the June Acreage survey is an increase of 237,000 acres. The most substantial increase occurred in 2014 with a 3.35 million acreage change. A decrease of 3.06 million acres in 2007 was the greatest acreage reduction from March to June. The USDA's Acreage report to be released on June 29 will reveal any acreage changes from intentions published in the March survey.\\n\\nWeather and trade issues will dominate price movements in the soybean market over the next few weeks. Strong crop conditions, a lack of information regarding trade negotiations, and uncertain acreage totals will continue to apply pressure on soybean prices in the near term. A change in the weather or trade negotiations, both very hard to predict, appear necessary for a rally in soybean prices.\",\n",

The new tool can be found at www.canolacalculator.ca alongside calculators for target plant density and seeding rates.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In combine adjustments for all crops, we are trying to balance productivity with harvest losses and grain quality but most producers know firsthand the particular challenge this can pose for canola harvest,” says Angela Brackenreed, CCC agronomy specialist. “We often see an unacceptable level of loss that is frustrating to correct.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2016, the CCC released a video explaining the loss measurement process and revamped the Combine Seed Loss Guide . Brackenreed says the combine optimization tool is a valuable follow-up. “Simply suggesting that setting adjustments need to be made when there are high losses is much easier said than done, particularly with challenging harvest conditions.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe combine optimization tool takes the traditional diagnostic settings flowchart and puts it into a web-based application you can access on your phone. Growers can go through a stepwise process based on the harvesting issue they’re experiencing (i.e. grain loss, grain sample quality or productivity) and review the adjustment options most likely to correct the issue.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoel McDonald, program manager of Agricultural Development Services at PAMI’s Humboldt facility points out that the optimization tool can be used for any make or model of combine. “It could be 25 years before most combines on the Prairies have built-in sensor technology that creates self-adjusting machines. Until then, there are tens of thousands of combines that rely on the operator and this guide is a new way for PAMI and CCC to reach them with the information they need when they need it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAngela Brackenreed and Joel McDonald will be presenting on combine grain loss and the new combine optimization tool at Ag in Motion.

Similar to the state’s wheat crop, canola was affected by challenging weather conditions. Limited soil moisture, cold winter temperatures, a cool start to spring, and a warmer-than-normal May contributed to reduced biomass, shorter flowering and grain filling periods, and lower yield potential. Despite these challenges, yields tended to be somewhat better than expected.\\n\\nYields were the lowest where plant stands were thinned by cold temperatures in late December 2017 and early January 2018. Yields were the highest where plant stands remained relatively intact. This was particularly true near Manhattan. Variety trials were planted in mid-September after a three-quarters inch rain, allowing the plants to achieve adequate fall growth going into the winter months. Even though temperatures dropped below 0 degrees F six times, with a minimum low temperature of -8 degrees F, winter survival still averaged near 90%.\\n\\nTrial sites for the canola breeding program were harvested at Colby, Garden City, Manhattan, and Norwich. Cultivar averages were in the upper 30s near Manhattan and upper 20s/low 30s near Norwich. The Colby and Garden City trial sites was negatively affected by hail (results are pending). Trial sites near Hutchinson and Kiowa were lost to poor establishment. Trial sites near Belleville and Troy were lost to poor establishment and eventually winterkill because the plants were too small for overwintering.\\n\\nOne positive outcome to the challenging year is that 2018 was a good year for rating winter survival. Winterkill does not occur every year in canola so in colder years it is important to see differences in survivability. We continue to add to our knowledge base about how particular cultivars handle the cold. This information provides us with a means for making better variety recommendations and advancements.\\n\\nThe 2018 National Winter Canola Variety Trial (NWCVT) entries are provided in Table 1.

Total ARC payments on the wheat base will be about $126 million.\\n\\n\\n\\nDue to strong yields in 2017, the six Red River Valley counties and Sargent County will most likely not receive ARC payments on the wheat base.\\n\\n\\n\\nThirty-three counties, including the western half of the state, will receive the maximum ARC payment due to low wheat yields from drought.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe maximum payment rate per base acre for these counties range from $35.50 in Barnes County to $20.20 in Grant County.\\n\\n\\n\\nPayments are applied to only 85 percent of base acres; therefore, the effective rate averaged across all wheat base acres would range from $30.17 in Barnes County to $17.17 in Grant County. Thirteen counties in the eastern half of North Dakota should receive some ARC payment on the wheat base but less than the maximum.\\n\\n\\n\\nEighty percent of North Dakota’s nearly 1.2 million acres of barley base is enrolled in the PLC program. This is the first year with a PLC payment on barley.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe projected 2017 national marketing year average barley price of $4.50 per bushel is below the reference price of $4.95, which was set in the 2014 farm bill, and would trigger a 45-cent-per-bushel payment rate on the farm’s PLC payment yield.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, all counties but one in the western two-thirds of North Dakota will receive barley ARC payments.\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly all of the state’s corn and soybean bases are enrolled in ARC.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair for this meeting was Ken Currah (BASF)\\n\\nThank you to Maizex (Kirk Van Will) for sponsoring breakfast. The final meeting for this spring will be on June 26th starting at 7:00 am for breakfast (meeting starts at 7:30) at the Malibu. Frank Flanagan will be the chair.\\n\\nSynopsis: Conditions are getting extremely dry in some regions (parts of Huron, Grey, Bruce, etc.). There has been sporadic rainfall in other counties. A relatively dry spring is usually good for wheat and corn so many fields actually look quite good particularly in Perth County. A tremendous amount of hay has been cut and should be good quality. Weeds are becoming harder to control as they are hardening off. They may actually appear smaller than their growth stage due to a lack of moisture. Higher rates of water, (20 gallons/ac) should be used when spraying Eragon, Glyphosate and Merge to control fleabane. Overall, the corn crop is in reasonable good shape except for those fields that were planted under poor conditions. A large percentage of the crop is in excellent shape. There was a report that the seed trench may be opening up again in some fields planted “green”. Planters set up with appropriate closing wheels is essential for good success of fields planted green. Soybean stands range from excellent to very poor and everything in between. Overall, plant stands are an issue due to a number of reasons including seed corn maggot, root rots, crusting, deep planting, etc. In some cases seed imbibed water but then ran out of moisture to fully germinate. There is hope for a rain tomorrow but if that does not materialize many of these stands will be extremely poor and may need to be replanted. Agricorp received about 200 damage reports during the first two weeks of June with half of those due to excess rainfall and the other half due to extremely dry conditions. Re-plants are still under way. In the Niagara region some fields are just now fit to plant for the first time. Edible bean planting is nearing completion for many growers although planting is still underway in the Stratford area. Finding moisture to seed into is a challenge this year. It was reported that soils are still “gummy” underneath the top 3 to 4 inches while the top has turned powder dry. Some growers are waiting for moisture before planting. Edible bean fields that have emerged are consistently weak in terms of plant stands this year. This does not necessarily impact yield negatively if the stands are consistent.\\n\\nWheat: Some wheat stands are variable and considerable discolouration is still evident. In the driest areas wheat is starting to flare up due to a lack of moisture. Since wheat is considered a dry land crop, yields are often better than expected after a dry spring but kernel fill will be impacted in extreme cases. Stripe rust has been found in the St Mary’s area but the disease has not been widespread. There is also one field near Clinton that’s been reported with stripe rust. As temperatures increase, stripe rust becomes less of a concern now. Fusarium timing in wheat has been a challenge due to uneven stands and rapid growth. Although there was considerable T3 fungicide spraying in this area, there was not as much fungicide applied at the T3 timing in the southwest. It has been dry and the wheat grew so quickly that the ideal window for application was missed by some growers. In some cases the T3 was still applied even though it was late due to stripe rust concerns. Pre-harvest intervals must be considered now. Cereal leaf beetle(CLB) is still an issue. One CLB adult or larvae per stem warrants control after boot but prior to heading. If significant feeding is taking place on the flag leaf in the early heading stages, control may be warranted.\\n\\nCorn: The PSNT survey conducted by OMAFRA is showing that available N is slightly higher than the last few years at 12.7 ppm compared to 11.7 ppm from the last few years. There is lots of 6-8 leaf corn that is very dirty this year. These are from plots with no N applied. If applying late season Nitrogen either as sidedress or in a Y drop is it worth considering some Sulphur. Little trial data exists on S timing on corn but generally speaking it would be reasonable to expect a yield response in fields that are low in S. Ontario research has shown a ½ bu/ac/day to 3 bu/ac/day loss in yield if weeds are not controlled. Those that emerge at the same time as the crop are the most damaging. For example waiting from the 3 leaf to 4 leaf stage in corn can cost 10 bu/ac in yield. Generally speaking the best strategy for corn is to start clean and stay clean from emergence to the 6 leaf stage. Some purple corn is also evident as is yellow flash from herbicide applications. Callisto “flash” is evident on overlaps. There are hybrid differences. Lower spray water volumes will increase the likelihood of burn(less than 10 gallons/acre). As the corn plant metabolizes the product will green up. This usually takes 7 to 10 days.\\n\\nSoybeans: Soybeans planted around May 18th have the poorest stands due to cold growing conditions following planting. The normal mortality in soybeans is 20%. A germination rate of 90% multiplied by an emergence rate of 90% equals an 81% plant stand. Ontario trials have shown that a 75% stand in no-till and an 80% stand in conventional tillage is quite normal. Soybeans can compensate for poor stands to a degree but there are parts of Lambton, Bruce, Grey, Essex, Chatham/Kent, Elgin, and Niagara, where soybeans stands are a real challenge. Poor stands due to crusting, seed corn maggot, root rots, deep planting, excess residue, heavy rains after seeding, or extremely dry conditions have resulted in some tough fields. Experience has shown that soybean seed sitting in dry conditions can emerge over a long period of time (4 – 5 weeks) so many of these stands will likely still thicken up over time when it rains. However, seed that has imbibed enough water to swell up but then run out of moisture to fully germinate will only survive a few days without additional moisture. Lambsquarter is beginning to harden off. If using Reflex and Basagran use 20 gallons/ac of water plus 2 L of Turbocharge / 1000. If spraying into next week consider increasing water and surfactant rates to improve efficacy. The time of day applications are made is also important. If spraying in the evening when the leaves are up or in the morning when there is dew efficacy is greatly reduced. Spray during the heat of the day. There was a report of 2-4 D damage that was applied about 4 days prior to seeding. Research has shown that although there can be leaf strapping, the crop will recover with essentially no yield loss.\\n\\nUpcoming Event\\n\\nSouthwest Crop Diagnostic Days – July 6 and 7, 2016\\n\\nFarmSmart Expo – July 14\\n\\nEastern Crops Day – July 28\\n\\nSource : fieldcropnews',\n",

This agreement addresses the Commissioner of Competition's concerns that the proposed transaction would have significantly harmed competition and innovation in Canada's agricultural sector.\\n\\nFollowing an extensive review, the Bureau concluded that the proposed acquisition would likely substantially lessen and prevent competition in Canada with respect to the supply of canola seeds and traits, soybean seeds and traits, seed treatments that protect crops against nematodes, and carrot seeds.\\n\\nTo address those concerns, the agreement requires Bayer to sell its canola seed and traits business, soybean seed and traits business, carrot seed business, nematode seed treatment business, glufosinate-ammonium herbicide business, LibertyLink herbicide tolerance technology, assets related to the Centurion herbicide, and digital farming business in Canada. Bayer has proposed BASF SE as the buyer of the assets under the agreement. The Bureau is actively reviewing the suitability of BASF as the proposed buyer of these assets.\\n\\nThe Bureau is satisfied that the agreement will preserve competition and innovation in important agricultural inputs such as canola seeds, Canada's highest acreage crop.\\n\\nGiven that Bayer and Monsanto's businesses operate in many countries and the global nature of the transaction, the Bureau coordinated its review with other jurisdictions, including the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ). The Bureau's strong relationships with the European Commission and the U.S. DOJ resulted in an efficient review of this matter.\\n\\nThe Bureau will publish a comprehensive position statement on its review in the coming days.\\n\\nQuick Facts\\n\\nOn September 14, 2016, Bayer and Monsanto signed a definitive agreement under which Bayer proposed to acquire Monsanto for US$128 per share.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy: THE OMAFRA FIELD CROP TEAM\\n\\nPlanting conditions have been good in many parts of the province; however, there are some areas that have been too wet, resulting in delayed planting. Areas affected include the heavy clay soils in Essex, Chatham-Kent, Lambton, Elgin, Haldimand and Niagara. Corn, soybean and canola planting have also been delayed in many parts of northern Ontario due to late spring and poor drying conditions. As conditions improve in these areas, growers who are anxious to get back into the field need to remember to be safe on the farm and the roads.\\n\\nOverall, crop emergence has been good. However, some of the early planted heavier soils have had poor emergence from poor seed to soil contact and poor seed slot closure in damp fine texture soils.\\n\\nWinter Wheat:\\n\\nThe most advanced winter wheat is at the early boot stage, with a few awns becoming visible (Zadoks scale 49) in southwestern Ontario. Most of the winter wheat crop is in the early to full flag leaf stage (Zadoks scale 37 to 39) with most of the acreage in good condition. There is still the odd thin stand that may be replanted to another crop. Nitrogen has been applied to most of the wheat with the exception in areas which have been too wet to get into the fields (heavy soils). It is now too late for in-crop weed control as herbicides now could negatively affect yield. Fields that received a fall herbicide have significantly better weed control this year. With the exception of some specific areas, the disease pressure has been low so far in most stands. There have only been a few reports of powdery mildew and septoria pressure. Most of the early fungicide applications have been applied. Fields should be scouted for cereal leaf beetle (CLB), as infestations are more widespread this year and have the potential to reach threshold in several fields. The threshold for control is one CLB adult or larvae per stem after boot but prior to heading. If significant feeding is taking place on the flag leaf in the early heading stages, control is warranted.\\n\\nSpring Cereals:\\n\\nMost of the intended spring cereal acres have been planted. The early planted spring cereals have emerged and most stands look good. Some stands on heavier soils that were worked on the damp side are thin.\\n\\nForages:\\n\\nPastures have had slow growth so far this spring, particularly noticeable where pastures were heavily grazed last fall. In some situations the livestock have had to be turned out too early due to low on-farm forage inventories.\\n\\nHay stand growth has improved significantly in the past week. In southwestern Ontario, 1st cut will begin near the end of the week. These fields cut early should be scouted for possible alfalfa weevil larvae feeding on the regrowth.\\n\\nCorn:\\n\\n80 to 90% of the intended corn acres have been planted in areas where the soil conditions have allowed. Less than 1% of the intended corn acres have been planted on the heavy clay soils in the Essex, Lambton and Haldimand to Niagara areas. These fields will require a week or more of dry weather for planting to start. This area makes up approximately 15% of the intended corn acres. The date for switching hybrid maturities was May 25th at London and May 30th at Ridgetown.\\n\\nSoybeans:\\n\\nAbout 25% of the intended provincial soybean acreage has been planted to date, with very few acres planted on the heavier clay soils. More growers are planning for weed control programs to control Canada fleabane.\\n\\nCanola:\\n\\nMost intended acres have been planted in southern Ontario, but planting has been delayed in northern Ontario due to poor soil drying conditions. The early planted spring canola has emerged and is looking great. The winter canola is in full bloom.\\n\\nEdible Beans:\\n\\nFew acres are planted to date. Planting the 1st week of June is considered the normal planting date to avoid the risk of frost damage.\\n\\nSource : Field Crop News',\n",

       "     'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSiobhan Hughes and Jesse Newman reported on the front page of Saturday’s Wall Street Journal that, “The House defeated a Republican-written farm bill on Friday after GOP leaders couldn’t win over a bloc of their party’s most conservative lawmakers, who were demanding a separate vote soon on a measure to toughen immigration enforcement.\\n\\n“The conservatives, members of the House Freedom Caucus, broke with their party even as leaders tried to persuade them that an immigration measure they wanted to bring to the floor would come up in June as part of a series of other immigration votes . The group instead wanted an immediate vote on a specific bill that would reduce legal immigration and add enforcement measures.\\n\\n“As a result, the farm bill was defeated, with 198 lawmakers in favor and 213 opposed . Thirty Republicans joined 183 Democrats in opposition.”\\n\\nThe Journal article noted that, “House GOP leaders needed most Republicans to stay on board because Democrats had already opposed the bill, objecting to new work requirements that would be imposed on food-stamp recipients.”\\n\\nPolitico writers Catherine Boudreau, Helena Bottemiller Evich, Rachael Bade, and Liz Crampton reported Friday that, “Rejection of the legislation is reminiscent of the last farm bill cycle in 2013, when the House also voted down a conservative version of the legislation, delaying the process for months. Ultimately, the sweeping bill was bailed out by Democrats the following year .”\\n\\nThe Politico article also reminded readers, “[Friday’s] vote came after a 48-hour standoff between GOP leadership and members of the Freedom Caucus . The bloc of conservatives held the bill hostage, demanding that the House first vote on controversial immigration legislation in exchange for their support for the sweeping agriculture and nutrition legislation.”\\n\\nReuters writers Amanda Becker and Susan Cornwell pointed out Friday that, “House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy were seen on the floor of the chamber negotiating with Freedom Caucus lawmakers as the farm bill vote was under way.”\\n\\nAnd Glenn Thrush and Thomas Kaplan reported on the front page of Saturday’s New York Times,\\n\\nIn reality, the farm bill, which has huge implications for low-income families and the agricultural industry, largely became a bargaining chip in the heated intraparty battle over immigration, President Trump’s core cultural and political issue.\\n\\nThe Times article noted, “The House’s farm bill was already destined to be set aside by the Senate, which has been working on its own bipartisan measure. The farm legislation will need 60 votes in the Senate, meaning that Republicans, even if they are unified, will not be able to pass a partisan bill in that chamber.”\\n\\nSaturday’s article added, “[House Ag Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R., Tex.)] and other mainstream Republicans from rural areas wanted to preserve backbone agricultural supports while fighting back challenges from the right to reduce subsidies. But he also sought to accommodate the White House and outside conservative groups, which demanded new election-year initiatives to reduce the rolls of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , or SNAP, which Mr. Trump regards, along with Medicaid and housing aid, as ‘welfare.'”\\n\\nWashington Post writers Erica Werner and Mike DeBonis reported on the front page of Saturday’s paper that, “The farm bill had nothing to do with immigration, but House conservatives used it to try to regain leverage that they had been losing behind the scenes as party centrists worked to force a vote on a bill that would legalize young undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children.”\\n\\nThe Associated Press reported on Friday that, “As for the farm bill’s fate, the debacle appears to make it even more likely that Congress will simply extend the current farm bill when it expires in September.”\\n\\nAnd Bloomberg writers Alan Bjerga and Erik Wasson reported Friday that, “President Donald Trump ‘is disappointed in the result of today’s vote,’ Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement. Trump supported adding work requirements to the food stamp program. The administration ‘will continue to work with Congress to pass a farm bill on time.'”\\n\\nFarm Bill- Amendments\\n\\nIn his weekly Email newsletter, House Ag Committee Ranking Member Collin Peterson (D., Minn.) explained that, “This week the House of Representatives considered the farm bill, and a number of amendments. I worked to defeat an amendment that would have devastated the domestic sugar industry and the thousands of jobs it supports in Minnesota.”\\n\\nRep. Peterson added, “I also fought against an amendment that would have made cuts to crop insurance as well as dairy and commodity safety net programs. These programs provide a critical backstop to protect against market swings and unpredictable weather which can wipe away a year of hard work in a blink of the eye. I was glad to soundly defeat these amendments because they are bad for agriculture and they make it harder to get a farm bill signed into law in the future.”\\n\\nHouse Ag Committee Chairman Mike Conaway also referenced votes on in the amendment process on Friday. In a statement, he noted that, “We experienced a setback today after a streak of victories all week.”\\n\\nIn addition, Brownfield’s Larry Lee reported last week that, “A House Farm Bill amendment from Illinois Congressman Darin LaHood received strong support from Democrats and Republicans Thursday. ‘Under our amendment, farmers will be able and be eligible for a one-time sign-up for ARC and PLC for the duration of the five-year farm bill so long as there are no changes to the current farming operation.’\\n\\n“LaHood told House members his One and-Done proposal would save farmers valuable time. ‘The amount of time spent filling out paperwork for these programs, even when there is no change to their farming operation, takes up too much time, too much of their valuable time which could be used on their farms.'”\\n\\nFarm Bill- Going Forward\\n\\nDTN Political Correspondent Jerry Hagstrom and DTN Ag Policy Editor Chris Clayton reported Friday , “The setback adds to the possibility of an extension that could complicate farmers’ ability to switch commodity programs next fall for their base acres. Declining revenue guarantees for the Agricultural Revenue Coverage (ARC) have led to the likelihood that farmers enrolled in ARC are looking for the chance to switch at least some farms to Price Loss Coverage (PLC) for their safety net.”\\n\\nHagstrom and Clayton pointed out that, “Peterson said that the bill can still get done this year, but an extension would have only two problems:\\n\\nfarmers’ inability to change from the Agricultural Risk Coverage to the Price Loss Coverage program, and no increase in acreage under the Conservation Reserve Program. The dairy program has already been fixed, he said.\\n\\nAnd Bloomberg writers Alan Bjerga and Erik Wasson reported on Saturday that, “Some Democrats see an opportunity amid the Republican disarray, saying that if Ryan were willing to eliminate the new food stamp rules, they could help pass a bill.\\n\\n“‘This is a good opportunity for us to return to the table and fix this bill before we move forward,’ said Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee.”\\n\\nThe Bloomberg article added, “Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 House Republican, said leaders would continue to seek to address Freedom Caucus immigration concerns to get the farm legislation passed. ‘The farm bill is an important bill. We’re not done with it,’ he said.”\\n\\nSource : Farm Policy News\",\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Tom Meersman\\n\\n\\n\\nMama pigs at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris have a somewhat cushy life compared to those in most conventional hog farms. The pregnant sows live together in small groups with straw bedding, unlike the traditional swine housing of individual stalls and slotted flooring above concrete manure pits, where sows have only enough room to stand up or lie down during their 114 days of gestation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudying group housing for pregnant sows is one of the ways that researchers at the U’s West Central Research and Outreach Center are helping pork producers and processing companies respond to public pressure about animal welfare in the swine industry. Recent studies include housing options for pregnant sows, aggressive behavior of swine in confinement, and how different amounts of living space affect swine behavior, growth rates, stress and other factors.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A lot of our effort has been to address societal concerns about pork production,” said swine scientist and operations director Lee Johnston. “Those concerns are raised by consumers and market chains, and producers in turn are asking themselves and us how to respond to those market signals or satisfy those questions and demands.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSome questions are about animal welfare, he said, and some are about nutrition and feed additives.\\n\\n\\n\\nProtests against confinement of pregnant sows and treatment of pigs are not new, but they were brought to the surface again two weeks ago when the international animal welfare group Mercy for Animals presented undercover video of what it called cruelty to pigs and sows by a Hormel supplier in Oklahoma, the Maschhoffs. Both Hormel and Maschhoffs said they have strict codes of conduct and policies related to animal care, and both launched investigations.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the U’s center near Morris in west-central Minnesota, Johnston and associate professor Yuzhi Li, an expert in swine behavior and welfare, have been on the forefront of animal welfare and nutrition issues for the swine industry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe center has barns that accommodate about 60 breeding sows, 900 nursery pigs and 800 finishing pigs (those from about 50 pounds to full-grown market weight of about 280 pounds). The farm is nowhere near the size of some commercial operations, Johnston said, but it’s large enough to conduct research that pork producers don’t have the time, space, money or expertise to study on their own.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome studies are financed by the National Pork Board and the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, but funds also come from state and other sources.\\n\\n\\n\\nYuzhi said there’s a difference between how activists and scientists approach animal welfare concerns. For advocates, she said, animal welfare is primarily a moral value to be achieved, whereas scientists measure animals’ performance, behavior and health.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We want to assess and evaluate animal welfare objectively, even though it’s a value issue,” she said. “We want to be sure animal welfare is safeguarded based on science and knowledge, rather than just saying that animal welfare is bad or good.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJohnston said there are economic considerations as well, and sometimes a disconnect between living conditions that consumers want to see — lots of space for sows and pigs — and the reality of what producers can manage or afford.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we have a farm with 3,000 sows and we go to a pen configuration with 20 percent more space, all of a sudden you’re down to 2,500 sows with pretty much the same cost structure as you had before,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe farmer must either make less money on the smaller herd, he said, or spend more in construction costs to build an addition to the barn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality for producers, Johnston said, is that in most markets they’re not getting paid any more per pound for pigs or sows raised with more space, even if that might be better in some respects for the animals.\\n\\n\\n\\nSherrie Webb, director of swine welfare at the National Pork Board, said there are benefits and drawbacks to both individual stalls and group housing. Individual stalls allow each sow to get the exact amount of nutrition that she needs, and the animals can be monitored more closely for health problems. But group pens allow more freedom of movement and the ability to interact socially with other sows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Most of the time that’s positive, but pigs do have to establish social hierarchy and groups,” Webb said, “and it sometimes results in aggressive behaviors that can be detrimental to their well-being and cause injuries.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s something that Yuzhi has studied in Minnesota: whether there may be ways to reduce aggression by mixing the same or different ages of sows in group housing, or changing the manner or time that they are introduced to each other and providing “escape” places in the pens where less aggressive sows can avoid fights.\\n\\n\\n\\nWebb said that research in Minnesota, which produces more pork than any other state except Iowa and North Carolina, is key as the industry tries to accommodate consumer demands for changes.\\n\\n\\n\\nNine states, not including Minnesota, have regulations that require group housing for sows, she said. There are no published data on how much of the national pork industry has switched to group housing for sows, Webb said, but it’s clear that animal welfare is a growing research interest, whether it be in livestock production, companion animals or laboratory animals.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther recent projects at the center in Morris have aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the swine industry by using solar and wind technology and conservation.\\n\\nOne study tested piglets to determine whether the traditional practice of keeping temperatures constantly at 86 degrees in pig nurseries could be dropped 10 degrees at night. Scientists found that cycling temperatures made no difference in growth rates, health or behavior of the animals, and could save producers 20 to 30 percent of heating and electric bills.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the largest studies focuses on floor space for pigs as they grow to market weight. Commercial operations typically provide about 8 square feet per pig, Johnston said.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinnesota and four other universities are now analyzing results of identical studies to see what happens when hogs are raised in five different floor plans with space ranging from 7.6 to 11.6 square feet. The diet, number of pen mates and feeder spaces were all the same, Johnston said, so the only difference was the amount of space per pig.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We measured growth rate, feed intake, and efficiency of gain,” he said, as well as lesions on pigs because of fighting or injury. The researchers also placed cotton ropes in the pens, which curious pigs will chew on, to collect and analyze saliva and hormones that indicate stress levels.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe goal, Johnston said, is to provide data so that producers can choose the best floor space allowance for animals to do well, while still being economical.\\n\\nThose kinds of changes may not go far enough for animal welfare advocates, but Webb said it depends on the goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If the objective is that pigs should not be raised for food at all, then it’s hard to find common ground,” she said. “But if the objective is to achieve good welfare and look for ways to continuously improve how we raise pigs, then we may be able to bridge that gap and address some of those concerns.”\\n\\nSource: umn.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Cadman Power Equipment and OMAFRA http://www.cadmanpower.com\\n\\nWouldn’t it be nice if liquid manure application could wait until after corn planting was completed, with little risk of compaction or damage to corn plants?\\n\\nIt may be the dog-days of summer, but kicking tires at an equipment demonstration and field day is a good way to evaluate how the newest technology may fit into your operation at some point in the future.\\n\\nThe North American Manure Expo, held August 3-4, 2016 near London, Ohio, provided an opportunity to watch a variety of new manure application equipment. Each year, Ontario manure equipment manufacturers demonstrate that they are industry leaders in manure application innovation.\\n\\nIn particular, the liquid manure demonstrations at this year’s Expo focused on in-crop application opportunities. The benefits of in-crop application are that they can:\\n\\n* Increase the economic benefit of the nutrients in manure by placing them where the crop can use them when the crop needs them.\\n\\n\\n\\n* reduce compaction by applying nutrients when the soil conditions are fit\\n\\n\\n\\n* reduce phosphorus movement to water courses, compared to applications during the non-growing season\\n\\n\\n\\n* benefit the soil microorganisms by increasing the biomass, and organic matter returned to the soil\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduced for the first time this year was the Cadman Power Equipment Continuous Manure Applicator (CMA), an in-crop drag hose system. The (CMA) was engineered to apply liquid manure via side-dress to row crops (30 inch row spacings) in fields as long as 2500 ft. (800 m).\\n\\nThe tractor pulls the injector with a patented swivel arm and 5.1 inch hard hose away from the CMA reel, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. When the tractor gets to the opposite end of the field, it turns 180o to the next set of rows and comes back down the field (Figure 3). When the tractor turns, the swing arm moves to the side of the tool bar, therefore keeping the hose in the same row that it was pulled out on. The tractor returns at the same speed it was pulled out at to synchronize with the reel rewind speed.

While the operator is completing the return trip, the remote hard hose moves forward 60 or 80 ft. to start another pass.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a big difference between coarse grind and fine grind, and it’s not just in our morning coffee. When it comes to grinding grain for livestock feed, especially swine, digestibility and efficiency are influenced by how large the grain particles are. Typically, the finer the grind the better —up to a point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew research by Kansas State University shows commercial laboratories and livestock producers who run their own analyses on grain-particle size can reduce the time it takes to check a sample from 15 minutes down to 10 minutes and get the same result by making a couple of changes to the process.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Grain accounts for a major component and cost in livestock diets,” said Charles Stark, associate professor in K-State’s Department of Grain Science and Industry. The particle size of ground grain influences feed digestibility, feed efficiency, how well it mixes and how well it can be pelleted, so periodic particle-size evaluation is a necessary part of quality feed manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor that reason, Stark and other K-State researchers and specialists recommend routine evaluation of the grinding process, whether through a hammer mill or roller mill to determine grain-particle size.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cost of the equipment needed to run such analyses, however, typically runs $5,000 or more, he said, so most producers in Kansas send grain samples to commercial laboratories or the K-State Swine Lab for analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the analysis process, grain samples go through a stack of sieves with coarse sieves at the top. As a machine shakes and taps, the grain works its way down through increasingly fine sieves, and ultimately to where the sieve opening is smaller than the smallest particle. The small sieves get down to particles of about 53 microns.\\n\\n\\n\\nStark outlined new recommendations based on the research at the recent K-State Swine Day 2016 in Manhattan and in a new publication, Evaluating Particle Size of Feedstuffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new recommendations for running feed through a sieve to determine particle size are to use sieve shakers; sieve agitators, such as rubber balls or brushes; a dispersing or flow agent such as silicon dioxide; and to use 10 minutes of sieving time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is different than what many labs are doing, Stark said, and it’s been adopted by the K-State Swine Lab. Until now, the analysis process typically included a 10- or 15-minute sieving time and often hasn’t incorporated sieve agitators or flow agents, but K-State’s work indicates that a 10-minute sieving time is sufficient if labs incorporate sieve agitators and a dispersing agent.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout sieve agitators or a dispersing agent, buildup occurs on the sieves, which keeps grain particles from moving through, making the results less accurate than they should be.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe research results showed that 10-minute cycles and 15-minute cycles with the sieve agitators are basically identical, so Stark and other K-State specialists believe 10 minutes with the agitators and flow agent will give the result needed, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“With all of the different methods used in the industry and commercial labs, it’s important to know how your lab is conducting the analysis and that adding the agitators and flow agent will significantly reduce the particle result,” Stark said.\\n\\nSource: k-state.edu',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom USDA Release www.usda.gov\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) today announced updated regulations to protect the rights of farmers. The Farmer Fair Practices Rules target the most harmful practices hurting farmers and clearly outlines common sense protections to restore fairness and reduce the burden for farmers seeking justice under the Packers and Stockyards Act. This is the most recent action in the Obama\\'s Administration\\'s efforts to level the playing field for all Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"For years, American farmers have been calling for protections against the most damaging unfair and deceptive practices confronting family farms across the country,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"Poultry growers in particular are vulnerable to market risks and concentration in the processor market. All too often, processors and packers wield the power, and farmers carry the risk. Today, USDA is taking a big step toward providing the protections that farmers deserve and need.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe four largest processors in the poultry sector in this country control 51% of the broiler market and 57% of the turkey market. In part due to this concentration, poultry growers often have limited options for processors available in their local communities to contract with. 52% of growers have only one or two processors in their state or region to whom they can provide grower services. That means processors can often wield market power over the growers, treating them unfairly, suppressing how much they are paid, or pitting them against each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new rules would level the playing field for farmers by proposing protections against the most egregious retaliatory practices harming chicken growers. The Farmer Fair Practices Rules are comprised of an interim final rule and two proposed rules GIPSA today sent to be published in the Federal Register. The interim final rule will affirmatively establish the Department\\'s long time position that it is not necessary to demonstrate that an unfair practice harms the entire market in order to prove a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Such overly broad interpretations have put family farmers at a disadvantage for decades when pursuing their rights under the Act.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe proposed rule regarding unfair practices would clarify what GIPSA views as practices that clearly violate the Act and would establish criteria to protect the legal rights of farmers. The third proposal would establish criteria that GIPSA would consider in determining whether a live poultry dealer has engaged in a pattern or practice to use a poultry grower ranking system unfairly.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an example of retaliatory practices, if a chicken grower attempts to organize other chicken growers to bargain for better pay or publicly expresses unhappiness with the way they are treated by a processor, processors could require growers to make investments that are not economically justifiable for the grower, or can terminate contracts with little notice. And because in contract growing, the processors own the birds and provide inputs like feed, they can choose to provide poultry growers with bad feed or sickly birds that have a higher mortality rate, which cuts deeply into a grower\\'s opportunity to earn income on those birds.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn hearings held in 2010, USDA heard from chicken growers who were promised a long-term business relationship but were soon bullied into signing narrower and narrower contracts until their business was unsustainable, who felt extorted into making expensive upgrades under threat of not being provided chickens to grow, and who tried to explore opportunities with other processors but were met with intimidation and discrimination.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Farmer Fair Practices Rules reflect feedback received in over 60,000 comments and rigorous economic analysis conducted by GIPSA in collaboration with the USDA Office of the Chief Economist. GIPSA is providing opportunity for additional comment on all of the rules, to ensure that the public has a robust opportunity to engage in the regulatory process.\\n\\nSource:usda.gov',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Tom Meersman\\n\\n\\n\\nMama pigs at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris have a somewhat cushy life compared to those in most conventional hog farms. The pregnant sows live together in small groups with straw bedding, unlike the traditional swine housing of individual stalls and slotted flooring above concrete manure pits, where sows have only enough room to stand up or lie down during their 114 days of gestation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudying group housing for pregnant sows is one of the ways that researchers at the U’s West Central Research and Outreach Center are helping pork producers and processing companies respond to public pressure about animal welfare in the swine industry. Recent studies include housing options for pregnant sows, aggressive behavior of swine in confinement, and how different amounts of living space affect swine behavior, growth rates, stress and other factors.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A lot of our effort has been to address societal concerns about pork production,” said swine scientist and operations director Lee Johnston. “Those concerns are raised by consumers and market chains, and producers in turn are asking themselves and us how to respond to those market signals or satisfy those questions and demands.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSome questions are about animal welfare, he said, and some are about nutrition and feed additives.\\n\\n\\n\\nProtests against confinement of pregnant sows and treatment of pigs are not new, but they were brought to the surface again two weeks ago when the international animal welfare group Mercy for Animals presented undercover video of what it called cruelty to pigs and sows by a Hormel supplier in Oklahoma, the Maschhoffs. Both Hormel and Maschhoffs said they have strict codes of conduct and policies related to animal care, and both launched investigations.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the U’s center near Morris in west-central Minnesota, Johnston and associate professor Yuzhi Li, an expert in swine behavior and welfare, have been on the forefront of animal welfare and nutrition issues for the swine industry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe center has barns that accommodate about 60 breeding sows, 900 nursery pigs and 800 finishing pigs (those from about 50 pounds to full-grown market weight of about 280 pounds). The farm is nowhere near the size of some commercial operations, Johnston said, but it’s large enough to conduct research that pork producers don’t have the time, space, money or expertise to study on their own.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome studies are financed by the National Pork Board and the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, but funds also come from state and other sources.\\n\\n\\n\\nYuzhi said there’s a difference between how activists and scientists approach animal welfare concerns. For advocates, she said, animal welfare is primarily a moral value to be achieved, whereas scientists measure animals’ performance, behavior and health.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We want to assess and evaluate animal welfare objectively, even though it’s a value issue,” she said. “We want to be sure animal welfare is safeguarded based on science and knowledge, rather than just saying that animal welfare is bad or good.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJohnston said there are economic considerations as well, and sometimes a disconnect between living conditions that consumers want to see — lots of space for sows and pigs — and the reality of what producers can manage or afford.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we have a farm with 3,000 sows and we go to a pen configuration with 20 percent more space, all of a sudden you’re down to 2,500 sows with pretty much the same cost structure as you had before,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe farmer must either make less money on the smaller herd, he said, or spend more in construction costs to build an addition to the barn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality for producers, Johnston said, is that in most markets they’re not getting paid any more per pound for pigs or sows raised with more space, even if that might be better in some respects for the animals.\\n\\n\\n\\nSherrie Webb, director of swine welfare at the National Pork Board, said there are benefits and drawbacks to both individual stalls and group housing. Individual stalls allow each sow to get the exact amount of nutrition that she needs, and the animals can be monitored more closely for health problems. But group pens allow more freedom of movement and the ability to interact socially with other sows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Most of the time that’s positive, but pigs do have to establish social hierarchy and groups,” Webb said, “and it sometimes results in aggressive behaviors that can be detrimental to their well-being and cause injuries.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s something that Yuzhi has studied in Minnesota: whether there may be ways to reduce aggression by mixing the same or different ages of sows in group housing, or changing the manner or time that they are introduced to each other and providing “escape” places in the pens where less aggressive sows can avoid fights.\\n\\n\\n\\nWebb said that research in Minnesota, which produces more pork than any other state except Iowa and North Carolina, is key as the industry tries to accommodate consumer demands for changes.\\n\\n\\n\\nNine states, not including Minnesota, have regulations that require group housing for sows, she said. There are no published data on how much of the national pork industry has switched to group housing for sows, Webb said, but it’s clear that animal welfare is a growing research interest, whether it be in livestock production, companion animals or laboratory animals.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther recent projects at the center in Morris have aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the swine industry by using solar and wind technology and conservation.\\n\\nOne study tested piglets to determine whether the traditional practice of keeping temperatures constantly at 86 degrees in pig nurseries could be dropped 10 degrees at night. Scientists found that cycling temperatures made no difference in growth rates, health or behavior of the animals, and could save producers 20 to 30 percent of heating and electric bills.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the largest studies focuses on floor space for pigs as they grow to market weight. Commercial operations typically provide about 8 square feet per pig, Johnston said.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinnesota and four other universities are now analyzing results of identical studies to see what happens when hogs are raised in five different floor plans with space ranging from 7.6 to 11.6 square feet. The diet, number of pen mates and feeder spaces were all the same, Johnston said, so the only difference was the amount of space per pig.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We measured growth rate, feed intake, and efficiency of gain,” he said, as well as lesions on pigs because of fighting or injury. The researchers also placed cotton ropes in the pens, which curious pigs will chew on, to collect and analyze saliva and hormones that indicate stress levels.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe goal, Johnston said, is to provide data so that producers can choose the best floor space allowance for animals to do well, while still being economical.\\n\\nThose kinds of changes may not go far enough for animal welfare advocates, but Webb said it depends on the goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If the objective is that pigs should not be raised for food at all, then it’s hard to find common ground,” she said. “But if the objective is to achieve good welfare and look for ways to continuously improve how we raise pigs, then we may be able to bridge that gap and address some of those concerns.”\\n\\nSource: umn.edu',\n",

       "     'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy David Burch\\n\\nHow to prevent five major pig diseases from ?occurring? The key to the answer often lies in the breeding herd. After all, negative sows breed ?negative piglets. In order to eradicate pathogens from the breeding herd, vaccines and especially ?antibiotics play a pivotal role.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a veterinarian, prevention of infections is a subject that is very close to my heart. Any article on dealing with pathogens and how to prevent them should touch on some basic rules that can avoid a lot of trouble.\\n\\nStarting with high health is the best place to be. Get reports of the health of breeding herds before purchasing stock. Get your vet to talk to their vet. Check the reliability of the breeding company from a disease perspective, not just on the genetic potential. If it brings disease on to the farm, it can blow away any of the genetic potential improvements you were hoping for. I have recently seen this with a hyper-prolific breeding herd but it spread Streptococcus suis as well.\\n\\nDon't merge farms. I am a great believer in closed herds, if possible; it stabilises immunity and reduces the risk of disease introduction. Every time new animals (gilts mainly) are brought on to the farm there is a risk of disease introduction and also they have to acclimatise to what infections are present. Importing semen is usually the safest option for limiting disease risk, whilst still being able to improve the herd's genetics. There have been recent occasions where boar studs have broken down with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSv), so nothing is totally risk free. Purchasing of pigs for finishing is always potentially high risk.\\n\\nBiosecurity is still the most important way of keeping disease out. It is critical for staying disease free or maintaining your current health status and must be a part of any eradication programme; otherwise the chances of long-term success are severely limited. On many farm visits, one finds biosecurity is minimal and surprisingly, when you ask “how did the disease come in?” the farmer knows but has not really done anything to stop further infections coming in – too much trouble? Or if they have carried out eradication before they expect it to break down within 6-12 months “like it did the last time.” I frequently say “think of the farm as a fortress and how best you can defend it and keep infections outside.”\\n\\nMore specific pathogens and prevention\\n\\nIf we look at prevention of disease we have been fortunate to have usually an array of vaccines, therapeutic drugs etc to control the effects of the disease. Improvements in management, housing, heating and ventilation, nutrition all have played a part. It is when we have got one infection, then another, then another, the effects of disease complexes can make a major impact on a farm's productivity and profitability and then the farmer usually considers the eradication option.\\n\\nA combination of PRRSv, which is immunosuppressive, Enzootic Pneumonia (EP), which can also be immunosuppressive and a pathogenic strain of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App), leading to the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a classic example. If the App isolate has developed resistance to the cheaper antibiotics like tetracyclines or trimethoprim/sulphas it is almost a necessity to go for the eradication option. Breaking down with swine dysentery is also a common reason to go for eradication because of its severity.\\n\\nMost eradication programmes are focused on eliminating infections from the breeding herd. There they usually have some immunity, a low level shedding of the virus or bacteria and a good chance of getting rid of the bug. Trying to eradicate infections from growing pigs is very difficult and also costly, so partial depopulation of the growing/finishing herd is important.\\n\\nClick here to see more...\",\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWalmart News\\n\\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. — Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. today announced new positions around animal welfare and the responsible use of antibiotics in farm animals, as a next step in continuously improving the sustainability of items it sells. Walmart is committed to a sustainable supply chain and food system, which means offering customers choices and transparency into how their food is grown and raised, and helping to further the fair treatment of animals.\\n\\n“Walmart is committed to selling products that sustain people and the environment,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and senior vice president of Walmart sustainability. “We have listened to our customers, and are asking our suppliers to engage in improved reporting standards and transparency measures regarding the treatment of farm animals.”\\n\\nHighlights of Walmart’s new animal welfare and antibiotics positions include:\\n\\nHumane Treatment of Farm Animals: Walmart is committed to offering affordable products in a way that is sustainable for people and the planet. Walmart believes that animals should be treated humanely throughout their lives. As part of its animal welfare position statement, Walmart will not tolerate animal abuse, supports the globally recognized “Five Freedoms” of animal welfare, and is committed to working with supply chain partners to implement practices consistent with the Five Freedoms. Walmart is asking suppliers to:\\n\\nReport and take disciplinary and corrective action in cases of animal abuse.\\n\\nFind and implement solutions to address animal welfare concerns in housing systems, painful procedures and euthanasia or slaughter.\\n\\nPromote transparency by providing progress reports to Walmart and publicly reporting against their own corporate animal welfare position on annual basis.\\n\\nResponsible Use of Antibiotics in Farm Animals:. Walmart believes that antibiotics should be used responsibly in farm animals, and with that in mind, the company is asking suppliers to:\\n\\nAdopt and implement the Judicious Use Principles of Antimicrobial Use from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) including accurate record-keeping, veterinary oversight, and limiting antimicrobial treatment to animals that are ill or at risk.\\n\\nAdopt and implement Voluntary Guidance for Industry #209 from the Food and Drug Administration in their own operations and their industry producer programs, including eliminating growth promotion uses of medically important antibiotics\\n\\nPromote transparency by providing a report on antibiotics management to Walmart and publicly report antibiotic use on an annual basis.\\n\\nIn October 2014, Walmart announced its commitment to a sustainable food system, outlining four key pillars to reach this goal: improving the affordability of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. By releasing its new antibiotic and animal welfare positions today, Walmart continues to build on this important commitment.\\n\\n“Our customers want to know more about how their food is grown and raised, and where it comes from. As the nation’s largest grocer, Walmart is committed to using our strengths to drive transparency and improvement across the supply chain,” said McLaughlin. “We believe it’s important to promote transparency in this process, helping to put our customers in charge of their food choices by providing clear, accurate information about food ingredients. We appreciate the leadership our suppliers have shown to help us accomplish these goals.”\\n\\nSource: Walmart',\n",

May 17th, 2016) Hypor has entered into an agreement with Tempel Genetics to execute and expand Hypor genetics in the U.S. market.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We are very happy to make this announcement, which is a significant step for our growth in the market,” says Hypor America General Manager Luis Prieto.\\n\\n\\n\\nHypor Landrace great grandparent (GGP) gilts from one of Hypor’s nucleus facilities in Saskatchewan, Canada will be moved to the Tempel Genetics’ nucleus facility in Indiana, U.S., in the coming weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Through the last 30 years we have been developing high quality genetics for the U.S. and the international market,” says Tempel Genetics owner Bill Tempel. “At this point, newer technology and bigger populations are needed in order to keep being competitive in the global genetics market.\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent customers of Tempel Genetics will benefit by receiving the full potential of Hypor’s genetics on their farms.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We fully trust the capability and willingness of Tempel Genetics to execute Hypor’s breeding program and to supply current and future customers with top quality genetics,” Prieto says.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe partnership will give Hypor access to a system of 1,900 GGP/GP sows in nucleus/multiplication helping to expand Hypor´s Landrace sow base.\\n\\n\\n\\nDue to this agreement, Tempel Genetics will end its current relationship with PureTek Genetics over the next 10 months.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe clear synergy between both company’s selection philosophy for balanced-animals ensures a long-lasting and stable relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Based on Hypor’s portfolio and the products that are currently under development at Hypor, we are very confident with our agreement decision,” Tempel says.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter considering different possibilities for their future and the future of their customers, Tempel Genetics chose to partner with Hypor based on Hypor’s selection philosophy, gene pool, and technology to produce balanced-animals—which will better serve US pork producers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Profitability in the pig chain and balanced breeding—the basis of Hypor’s genetics—have always been paramount ideas in our breeding program,” Tempel says. “That’s why we think Hypor aligns very well with us and with our customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n” Hypor values the ethics, the level of expertise and the knowledge in the breeding field that Tempel Genetics brings to the swine industry, and sees Tempel Genetics as a reliable partner for growing Hypor lines in the U.S. market.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One of Hypor’s strategic pillars is collaboration. Under this idea, we are always exploring win-win situations,” Prieto says. “And this partnership with Tempel Genetics is clearly one of them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Hypro',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Hypor News, www.hypor.com\\n\\nHypor is growing the number of pigs it tests by 25 percent with the addition of several Pig Performance feeding stations at its nucleus facility in Abernethy, Saskatchewan.\\n\\nThe feeding stations are expected to be installed by June 2016. Pigs from the Hypor nucleus facility in Ontario will be moved to the renovated Saskatchewan facility to increase the level of genetic value testing.\\n\\n“By increasing our feeding stations we’ll be able to collect more phenotypes and make faster genetic improvements for the whole swine industry,” says Hypor Director of Research and Development Abe Huisman. The new Nedap Pig Performance Test stations are the first to be located in Canada.\\n\\nThe Nedap Pig Performance Test stations record the amount of feed intake and the weight of the animal each time the pig visits the feeder. “This is something new and exciting for the industry—traditionally pigs are weighed only five times between birth and the end of the testing period,” says Huisman.\\n\\nData from the feeding stations shows the difference in daily feed intake and the daily weight gain of individual pigs and will advance the ability Hypor has to select pigs that meet the North American market demand for high feed efficiency later in the growing period.\\n\\n“Feed costs account for 60 to 70 percent of the total cost of production,” says Huisman. “If we can make pigs a little more efficient, we’ll be able to help producers be more profitable.”Hypor will use the data from the feeding stations to determine at what point a pig’s rate of daily gain slows down.\\n\\n“We want to select the pigs that are lean and efficient at the end of the growing period as well at the beginning of the growing period to stay in-line with the markets,” says Huisman. North American slaughter weights have increased steadily over the past 20 years.\\n\\nTo meet this market demand for lean, quality pork in heavier pigs, Hypor uses a real-time ultrasound device, versus a computed tomography (CT) scanner, to measure the marbling and muscle-to-fat ratio.\\n\\n“The ultrasound device allows us to collect more data than we would using a CT scanner which is limited to use on pigs that weigh less than 220 pounds,” says Hypor North America General Manager Luis Prieto. “The average live weight of market pigs is around 290 pounds.”\\n\\nSource : Hypor',\n",

Funding was used to:\\n\\nremove gestation stalls and replace them with a design that allows sows to move freely throughout the barn;\\n\\npurchase and install new feeding systems that use radio frequency identification tags to ensure each sow receives the appropriate nutrition; and\\n\\ntrain employees on the new systems and how to train the sows to use the feeders.\\n\\nThe 1,250-head barn conversion was completed last winter. As part of the funding agreement, research gathered from this barn conversion will be shared through factsheets, seminars and workshops with other Manitoba producers over the next two to five years. They will provide real-world data on barn design, equipment needs, animal nutrition and care, and employee training requirements. The 1,250-head barn conversion was completed last winter.\\n\\nManitoba uses the standards set under national codes of practice to enforce provincial legislation related to animal care and welfare. Earlier this year, the Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Pigs, a standard developed by the National Farm Animal Care Council, was updated. As a result, all hog barns built in Manitoba after July 1, 2014 must use loose housing models. There are stricter standards for existing barns, which must phase out gestation stalls by July 1, 2024. The code, which is available online at www.nfacc.ca also set out standards related to animal health, husbandry and transportation. Development of the code followed national public consultations that resulted in 4,700 submissions from producers, processors, veterinarians and animal welfare advocates.\\n\\nThis project is funded under Growing Forward 2 - Growing Assurance. In Manitoba, the federal and provincial governments are investing $176 million under Growing Forward 2, a five-year, federal-provincial-territorial policy framework to advance the agriculture industry, helping producers and processors become more innovative and competitive in world markets.\\n\\nSource: AAFC',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese days, quality can be hard to find, unless you know where to look. And if you’re seeking a boar that offers exceptional meat quality, look no further than the Hypor Kanto. As Hypor’s premium terminal sire line, the Hypor Kanto is renowned for its quality, growth and consistency. Hypor recently gathered data on Hypor Kanto offspring from a few commercial systems. The findings met or exceeded expectations on several fronts and confirmed why the Hypor Kanto can do wonders for your bottom line.\\n\\nHypor Kanto’s Commendable Growth The Hypor Kanto is Hypor’s fastest growing terminal sire line, and given the other lines Hypor offers, that’s saying a lot. In the latest assessment, the Hypor Kanto maintained a competitive and uniform average daily gain (ADG) of 2.2 lb/1 kg without compromising feed conversion ratio (FCR). With numbers like that, the only thing growing faster than the Hypor Kanto will be your business.\\n\\nHypor Kanto’s Quality\\n\\nOf course, growth without quality is like food without flavor: What’s the point? Fortunately, Hypor Kanto produces outstanding, flavorful pork that has earned praise for its color and marbling. “Since producers were not paid for meat quality in the past, there was no push for quality lines,” said Dr. Emily Miller, Hypor Product Manager. “With hopes of moving towards a standardized grading system for pork, consumers will be given the option to pay more for a high-grade product in their grocery store. We are the only company with a line of this caliber, which gives our clients a completive edge. ” Even now, the Hypor Kanto is the boar of choice for those who demand the best: Japanese and other export markets, high end restaurants and grocers, and you.\\n\\nHypor Kanto’s Consistency\\n\\nOne of the most notable findings from the latest data collected was that even for farms slaughtering at higher weights – around 150 kg live weight compared to the industry standard of 125 - 130 kg – the heavier pigs did not have greater back fat and had a good lean percentage. Normally, we expect a pig to be less efficient at converting feed to gain when heavier, but the Hypor Kanto maintained a competitive FCR from 125 kg to 150 kg. That’s critical for producers because it ensures that the only surprises they encounter with the Hypor Kanto are pleasant ones.\\n\\nHypor Kanto’s Commitment to TSP\\n\\nSince Total System Profitability is a must for clients, it’s a must for Hypor and the Hypor Kanto. In Miller’s words, “no matter who you are in the pork production chain, you will make money from the Hypor Kanto.” For producers, the Hypor Kanto’s combination of fast growth and superb meat quality controls costs while positioning them to earn a premium on their pigs in the years to come.\\n\\nFor processors, they will have a superior product that demands more from grocers and restaurants. As consumers begin to seek out higher quality and show a willingness to pay for it, they will shape how all members of the value chain run their business. And nothing is better for your business than giving the customer what they want. So if anyone says they can’t give you quality, growth and consistency in one boar line, tell them that’s okay. Hypor Kanto can.\\n\\nSource : Hendrix Genetics',\n",

They published their results in Frontiers in Microbiology in 2016.\\n\\nThe study revealed that the virus “could survive up to nine months in the infected EMS after the initial outbreak in the farm.”\\n\\nWeeks after the infected manure was added to the EMS, researchers found evidence suggesting that the virus had replicated. While no additional infected manure had been introduced into the EMS, samples revealed elevated levels of PEDv.\\n\\nThis finding suggests that EMS may contain alternative hosts for PEDv, the journal article stated.\\n\\nHowever, samples from the top layer of the EMS exhibited low levels of the virus. PEDv present in this layer was mostly non-infective.\\n\\nThese results suggest that “environmental factors, such as UV and sunlight, could diminish the replicability and infectivity of the virus.”\\n\\nSo, producers could potentially reduce the presence and infectivity of PEDv on their operations through frequent agitation of their EMS, the article stated.\\n\\nAfter completing this study, the researchers worked on a project to determine whether the virus could survive in soils after farmers applied PEDv-contaminated manure to land, Christine Rawluk, research coordinator with the National Centre for Livestock and the Environment, said in the Farmscape interview.\\n\\nResearchers recently finished the field investigations, which revealed “detectable levels of the virus in soil samples collected three weeks after surface applications,” Rawluk said.\\n\\nHowever, the team did not assess the virus infectivity during this study.\\n\\n“Future research will examine the survivability and infectivity (of PEDv) when infected manure is applied to different soil types under different climate conditions,” she said.\\n\\n“We still need to … determine the potential of soil to become a vector for spreading this disease.”\\n\\nPhoto: University of Manitoba',\n",

Canadian pork producers were represented by Mr. Kristensen during a very successful week-long trade mission to China led by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lawrence MacAulay.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am very thankful for having been able to join Minister MacAulay on the mission to China,” says Mr. Kristensen. “I was very proud to represent Canada and its pork producers during this trip and note the tremendous export opportunities present in China and the entire Asian region,” he explains.\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese consumers, on a per capita basis, consume close to three times the amount of pork eaten by Canadians. With a population of 1.4 billion people, China is a vast market opportunity for Canadian pork products. China’s fast-growing middle class is demanding ever-increasing volumes of safe, high-quality food, as well as premium products. Chinese consumers have a favourable view of imported foods and Canada is correctly viewed as a clean and wholesome supplier of safe, high-quality products.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, Canada is at risk of falling behind as producers in Australia, the European Union and the United States, in particular, have already positioned themselves as important suppliers of pork. Australia’s geographic advantage, new rail lines from the EU, and the USA’s strong focus on trade with China, mean they are becoming increasingly competitive.\\n\\n\\n\\nCapitalizing on the market opportunity requires greater market access to China, Japan and South East Asian nations. The Government of Canada must focus on securing a free trade agreement with China and move quickly to finalize the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\n\\n\\nCanadian Pork Council Chair Rick Bergmann is asking the Government of Canada to build on this momentum and make gains before other countries solidify their positions: “Gaining access to China for chilled pork products is one of the key avenues to growing the pork industry by gaining access to the premium retail store shelf.” An increase in\\\\ pork exports would contribute to Canada achieving its target of $75 billion in exports by 2025 as outlined in Budget 2017.\\n\\nSource: Canadian pork Council',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThermo Fisher Scientific today introduced the Applied Biosystems VetMAX PEDV/TGEV/SDCoV Kit, the first and only PCR test designed to simultaneously screen for three swine coronaviruses in environmental and feed samples.\\n\\nBiosecurity is key in controlling swine coronaviruses as they spread indirectly through air, dust, feed, transport and people. Environmental testing with molecular tools helps audit the success of biosecurity measures, such as disinfecting transport trailers and barn facilities, and it enables producers to quickly get information about the actual situation on the farm.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe VetMAX PEDV/TGEV/SDCoV Kit is a multiplex real-time PCR kit designed to detect three swine coronaviruses simultaneously using feed or environmental samples:\\n\\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) Swine delta corona virus (SDCoV)\\n\\nAll three coronaviruses cause similar clinical symptoms early in the disease, making it impossible to identify without testing which specific virus is at the root of the infection on the farm.\\n\\n“When an outbreak of swine coronavirus occurs, it is a result of fecal and oral contamination,” said Joe Connor, DVM and president and founder of Carthage Veterinary Service in Carthage, Ill. “Implementing intensive sanitation and complete disinfection of rooms, hallways, work areas and transport trailers are critical components to the control and elimination of swine coronavirus.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Studies we have been involved in indicate that if a PEDV contaminated load of hogs arrived at a harvest facility and the next transport of hogs was uncontaminated, there is a 70 percent chance that the uncontaminated truck would leave the plant contaminated,” said Dr. Connor. “This occurs just in the normal cross-traffic while unloading pigs at a harvest facility and is very difficult to avoid, which is why ensuring trucks are disinfected before re-entering the farm is critical.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe VetMAX PEDV/TGEV/SDCoV Kit allows herd health monitoring for the three viruses even with “dirty” environmental samples. Taking environmental swabs is a quick, easy and animal-friendly method to determine biosecurity on the farm and during transport. Samples can be taken from walls or floors of barns, trucks or harvest facilities using swabs or Swiffer® dry sweep cloths or from feed samples, feces scraped from the floor or air or dust.\\n\\n\\n\\nThermo Fisher has conducted extensive testing to validate the VetMAX PEDV/TGEV/SDCoV Kit on “dirty” environmental samples that contain higher levels of PCR inhibitors. During these tests, the kit has demonstrated >97% sensitivity and 100 percent specificity for all three targets.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe kit requires little preparation time because all reagents are ready-to-use and the three target pathogens and one positive control are run in one well, eliminating the need to run several PCRs per virus.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Swine coronavirus pathogens tests are highly requested by laboratories as more and more swine operations are tightening their biosecurity standards to closely monitor for these economically devastating diseases,” said Martin Guillet, global head and general manager of AgriBusiness at Thermo Fisher Scientific. “With this kit, we provide laboratories with an efficient tool to help strengthen biosecurity levels on farms.”\\n\\nSource: Thermofisher',\n",

However, combining animals from different farms can lead to a risk of virus and disease spreading between animals. Fairs need to be aware that disease or viral outbreaks can and sometimes do happen at their events and be prepared.\\n\\nRisks to animals and humans are magnified when the virus is zoonotic and can be transferred between animals and people. In particular, the swine influenza virus has certain strains that can be zoonotic and, at times, can be found at exhibitions. It is important that people responsible for the pigs housed at the fair monitor for sick pigs at fair check-in, taking the proper biosecurity steps to reduce the spread of disease, providing proper signage for fair visitors about proper hygiene and talking to exhibitors and parents about preventing influenza.\\n\\nMichigan State University Extension and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development have partnered to create resources for county fairs and exhibitions about swine influenza. This information is available to help prepare for fairs, monitor animals during exhibition and to help exhibitors and parents understand and use biosecurity and good hygiene practices.\\n\\nBelow are some tips that can help county fairs be proactive when checking in animals.',\n",

Engest is a natural, bio-based feed additive, simple to add to existing sow diets, that mitigates the negative impacts of stress while optimizing feed efficiency, gut health and nutrition capture.\\n\\n\"The sow is really the engine that drives swine production,\" says Wilbur-Ellis Feed’s Midwest Nutrition Sales Manager Bryce Martin. \"Yet, while there have been strong gains through genetics and management approaches, it\\'s also a focal point that has been largely untouched by feed additives.\"\\n\\nEngest features leading-edge Superzyme feed enzyme technology from Wilbur-Ellis partner Canadian Bio-Systems Inc., a leader in innovative multi-carbohydrase feed enzyme technology, in a custom formulation optimized to deliver multi-benefits for sows.\\n\\n\"Engest is designed to open the door for feed additives much wider as an option tailored to the needs of sows that delivers a quick, reliable and sustained return on investment,\" says Martin. \"It gives producers the opportunity to capture a lot of profit potential that has been largely untapped. It’s a \\'win-win\\' tool that is good for the animals and also good for production.\"\\n\\nEngest also serves as a viable alternative to not only meet, but far exceed the production benefits associated with medicated feed, providing a timely and valuable option following the January 1, 2017, full implementation of the new Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD), which greatly restricts medicated feed use.\\n\\n\"The direct benefits of Engest for sows also support multiple additional benefits that extend to the full herd and production cycle,\" says Wilbur-Ellis Feed’s Nutrition Product Group Manager Dennis McDermott. \"Examples include improved fertility, higher annual pigs per sow ratios with higher repeatability, reduced pre-weaning mortality and more productive piglets – all supporting significantly improved economics and profitability for swine operations.\"\\n\\nEngest also improves post-lactation recovery, further supporting the welfare of sows and allowing them to return to production sooner at a high level of comfort, health and energy.\\n\\n\"We knew this feed enzyme technology was a winner from its application results in other phases of swine production,\" says Wilbur-Ellis Feed’s Eastern Nutrition Sales Manager JD Baltzell. \"Engest focuses and further enhances this technology to maximize advantages for sows.\"\\n\\n\"It’s very exciting to see the strong and broad benefits Engest is producing, which confirms when you improve performance and welfare at the sow level it translates to gains across the full spectrum of production,\" says Martin. \"With Engest, producers ensure they get the most out of genetics and management approaches because those aspects are not undermined by stress or sub-optimal or depleted nutrition. For example, we see some approaches hitting the elusive 30 pigs per sow level – Engest can help support and bring in sustainable results to that type of achievement.\"\\n\\nTo learn more about Engest and Wilbur-Ellis Feed, visit booth 238 January 25 and 26 at the Iowa Pork Congress at the Iowa Events Center.\\n\\nSource: Wilbur-Ellis',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDewitt, Nebraska -- Waldo Genetics®, a swine genetics industry leader, is pleased to announce its second annual Waldo Genetics Swine Industry Scholarship recipients.\\n\\nWorld Pork Expo is an exciting event for the pork industry, but for Waldo Genetics this annual event has special meaning. For the second year in a row, Waldo Genetics has had the honor of presenting 2 students with scholarships during the Expo.\\n\\nThe annual scholarship is made available to eligible returning college students enrolled in an accredited Bachelor or Post-Grad program in Agriculture or Animal Science with an emphasis on the swine industry. Each year, Waldo Genetics awards 2 such students $1,000 each to support their academic pursuits.\\n\\n“We really enjoy giving back to our community. In fact, we believe doing so provides a unique opportunity for our customers to positively affect the lives of students pursuing a career in the swine industry and this is particularly rewarding,” said Linda Gibbs, Waldo Genetics CEO. “Announcing and presenting the scholarship each year at the World Pork Expo provides a great venue to publically showcase the young talent entering our industry. The future of our industry relies on the knowledge and passion of today’s students that will become tomorrow’s industry innovators. The industry’s future is in good hands.”\\n\\nTasha Gruhot, a student at Iowa State University and Cameron Menard, a student at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, each received $1,000 scholarships during the 2015 World Pork Expo in Des Moines, Iowa.\\n\\nThese 2 winners were chosen based on their comprehensive knowledge of and passion for the swine industry and their personal determination to positively influence the industry.\\n\\n“Choosing 2 finalists from the many impressive candidates was difficult. Just as last year, I’m, again, very impressed with the caliber of applicants to our scholarship program. These students are passionate about their studies and eager to make their mark as industry innovators,” said Gibbs.\\n\\nTasha Gruhot explains, “My goal is to become a veterinarian focused on the food animal industry within my community. Through research opportunities during my undergraduate studies, I’ve developed a respect for and interest in the swine production industry. I’m excited about the work being done to improve the swine industry through research and look forward to integrating my knowledge with producers.”\\n\\nCameron Menard shares, “I believe the most vital opportunity the industry has yet to take advantage of is transparency. We must promote not only our product, but also why we’re passionate about our work. It’s time we explain why we do what we do and help the public understand that no one is more concerned about the well-being of commercial hogs than the people dedicating their lives to working with them.\"\\n\\nSource: Waldo Genetics',\n",

This amount is an increase in the returns from previous years, which were $17.40 (2006 to 2011) and $13.80 (2001 to 2006) per dollar invested.\\n\\nProducers saw each dollar translated into the following benefits, Waetke said:\\n\\n$83.30 from production research to improve on-farm practices\\n\\n$24.70 from foreign market development\\n\\n$14.20 from advertising\\n\\n$12.40 from non-advertising promotion\\n\\n“The net return of 25:1 on Checkoff investments demonstrates that we are meeting producer needs in the areas that drive sustainable production and grow consumer demand,” Terry O’Neel, president of the NPB, said in the release.\\n\\nIn addition to the economic study, the NPB also released the results of its annual producer survey conducted in November.\\n\\nThe survey, which included 550 pork producers from across the country, reflected an improvement in producer support for the Pork Checkoff program for the eighth consecutive year.\\n\\n“Support for the Checkoff remained at 91 percent, while opposition declined to a record low of 3 percent,” the release stated.\\n\\nPhoto: National Pork Board',\n",

The announcement was made in conjunction with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the nation\\'s largest animal protection organization.\\n\\nInitially all hotels in the Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Canopy by Hilton and DoubleTree by Hilton brands will be required to switch all egg usage to cage-free by December 31, 2017, ensuring that chickens are not confined in cages. All pork products must be purchased from suppliers that house breeding pigs in groups rather than gestation crates by December 31, 2018. These changes will initially apply in 19 countries where products are currently available and will be adopted in additional markets as supply comes online. These actions are part of the company\\'s global responsible sourcing strategy, which includes a focus on animal welfare. Last year, Hilton announced a global ban of the sale of shark fin in all owned and managed properties.\\n\\n\"Hilton Worldwide\\'s new animal welfare commitment will substantially improve countless animals\\' lives,\" said Josh Balk, senior food policy director for The Humane Society of the United States. \"We welcome Hilton Worldwide\\'s leadership and look forward to helping the company progress in its work to make life better for farm animals.\"\\n\\n\"We are committed to addressing key issues throughout our business and supply chain and responsibly serving our guests and communities in a range of areas,\" added Jennifer Silberman, vice president, corporate responsibility for Hilton Worldwide. \"With more than 2,000 restaurants in our global footprint, our goal is to have a considerable impact on sustainable sourcing in our industry as well as drive humane treatment of animals throughout our supply chain.\"',\n",

This step can lower heating costs and the use of electricity, Teillet stated.\\n\\nAnother way that producers are lowering their carbon footprint is through the production of pigs themselves.\\n\\n“Pigs are larger, grow faster and use relatively less water and feed than previous (breeds),” said Teillet. This improvement “lowers our environmental footprint per kilogram of pork.”\\n\\nProducers might also look to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to reduce their impacts on the environment.\\n\\n“We are aware of at least one producer in Manitoba who recently installed a large solar array for his farm,” said Teillet.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Public oat breeding has taken a major blow with PepsiCo pulling funding support from all oat breeding research in Canada.\\n\\n“In total it’s nearly $600,000 per year that they’ve eliminated, so now PepsiCo/Quaker is not helping to fund any oat breeding programs in Canada as far as we know,” said Shawna Mathieson, executive director of the Prairie Oat Growers Association.\\n\\nQuaker, which was acquired by PepsiCo in 2000, had been a longtime oat research supporter in Canada, but is now the only major miller in Western Canada that isn’t helping to fund POGA research initiatives, Mathieson said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nPepsiCo began cutting funding to breeding programs in Canada in the middle of last year, including Agriculture Canada’s breeding program at Brandon, which helps support programs across Western Canada. Funding was also pulled from Agriculture Canada’s oat-breeding program in Ottawa.\\n\\nPepsiCo withdrew approximately $80,000 from public oat breeding programs run through Agriculture Canada research centres.\\n\\nHowever, the loss of funding is amplified because the Agriculture Canada funding scheme through Canadian Agricultural Partnership, which took effect April 2018, sees federal research money match industry funding.\\n\\nAs a result, the $80,000 hit from PepsiCo’s withdrawal is exaggerated by a further reduction of $80,000 in federal funding.\\n\\nBefore last April, Growing Forward and then Growing Forward 2 provided 75 percent of plant breeding funds.\\n\\nAs well, PepsiCo pulled $500,000 in funding from the oat breeding program at the University of Saskatchewan’s Crop Development Centre in Saskatoon at the beginning of this year.\\n\\nCAP had not been matching PepsiCo funding to the CDC, so the total loss of funding for oat breeding in Canada since last summer is $660,000, including the shortfall from PepsiCo’s withdrawal as well as the reduced federal funding.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAlan Butuk, an oat grower from Insinger, Sask., who sits on the POGA board, said funding responsibility for breeding research is being increasingly off-loaded onto farmers through checkoffs, even though the entire industry benefits from the research.\\n\\n“We’re certainly seeing that with the asks we’re getting at the Prairie Oat Growers Association. We’re getting more requests for funding because of the fact that a lot of the sectors are reducing the funding they’re putting in,” Butuk said.\\n\\n“When we see an industry pull out of funding like PepsiCo has done, do we slow down the research and we don’t advance as fast as other countries are? Or how do we find that middle ground, where we keep advancing and keeping pace with what other parts of the world are doing?”\\n\\nHe said public breeding programs are needed to help crop varieties adapt to upcoming changes in agriculture.\\n\\n“Public oat breeding will address concerns of many parts of the sector,” Butuk said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Some of the private ones tend to be more focused on the actual needs of their own markets. (Public breeding addresses) yield gains to bushel weights to disease control. The disease issues across Western Canada vary quite a bit, so if they only focus on one region you might not get the breeding research needed to cover all of the areas.”\\n\\nJennifer Mitchell Fetch, an oat breeder at Agriculture Canada’s Brandon research centre, said breeding will be challenging without PepsiCo’s support.\\n\\n“I believe we are going to have to drop some of the activities that we were doing, just because we don’t have the funding available,” she said.\\n\\n“We won’t be able to do as much as we were, but the other industry partners are still there, so the program will continue.”\\n\\nHer focus is to develop milling quality oat cultivars for Western Canada that have high beta glucan with a healthy amount of oil, high test weight and plump uniform seed so that millers can get the most efficient yield in their product.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“We also want good agronomically superior cultivars that the producers can plant on their land and know that they’ll get a good yield back, and it will be disease resistant and it will be an end product that the millers will want to buy,” Mitchell Fetch said.\\n\\nMathieson said POGA and the rest of the industry partners are trying to adjust to the loss of PepsiCo funding.\\n\\n“POGA encourages the Canadian oat growers to sell their oats to companies that are supporting their farms and families and those companies that appreciate the dedication required for long-term farming success,” Mathieson said.\\n\\nShe said PepsiCo sources nearly all of its oats for Quaker from Canadian growers.\\n\\nPepsiCo was asked to comment but didn’t make a representative available before press time July 16.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Dairy producers and the farming community around Elmira, Ont., are devastated.\\n\\nOn July 9, a semi-trailer truck crashed into a tractor driven by Henk and Bettina Schuurmans on Highway 16 north of Saskatoon. The couple, dairy farmers from Elmira, north of Kitchener, were travelling across Canada in a tractor to promote Canada’s dairy industry and the supply management system.\\n\\nBettina was killed in the accident and Henk was seriously injured. He had surgery in Saskatoon July 12 to treat his injuries.\\n\\n“It would be fair to say that people are in shock, and there’s a real outpouring of support,” said Wendell Schumm, ruminant division manager with Wallenstein Feed near Elmira and a friend of the Schuurmans.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“People want the Schuurmans’ family to know that they support them and are here for them, in whatever way they need.”\\n\\nThe Schuurmans’ children, Tom, Emily, Lize, Jim and Eric, asked Schumm to speak to the media in the aftermath of the tragedy.\\n\\nThe Schuurmans were driving across the country in a 6430 John Deere tractor with a plastic cow attached to the back so that they could talk to Canadians about dairy farming. They branded the trip as the Canadian Milk Tour.\\n\\n“They cared about the system, the Canadian dairy system. They wanted their kids to have the opportunity to take over that operation,” Schumm said.\\n\\n“It wasn’t something organized by Dairy Farmers of Canada…. It was a farm family proud of what (they) do and wanted to show people. It was really genuine. People got behind it, more so, because of that.”\\n\\nThat’s likely why a GoFundMe page for the Schuurmans, to help with expenses related to the accident and future costs, had raised $69,501 as of July 16.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“We at Slate River Dairy were deeply touched by this tragic accident. Henk and Bettina were at our farmers market just two short weeks ago,” Wilma Mol, who farms near Thunder Bay, said on GoFundMe.\\n\\n“Today we had a fundraiser at our booth and raised $346 for the Schuurmans. We know this will never replace the emptiness of losing a spouse or parent, but we pray this may just lighten the financial burden.”\\n\\nThe Schuurmans own and operate Milky Wave Farm near Elmira.\\n\\nHenk, who is from the Netherlands, was the manager of a dairy called Coopon Flora in Elmira for about 23 years, starting in 1990.\\n\\nThe Schuurmans bought the dairy in 2013. Following the purchase, Henk talked about his family’s history of farming and why he loves working in a dairy.\\n\\n“I’m the ninth generation farmer in my family.

       "     'text': 'Crop walk reveals uneven maturity, but farmers say their dryland crops look better this year than they did last year\\n\\nTURIN, Alta. — Variable maturity levels appear to be a common problem in southern Alberta canola fields lacking irrigation.\\n\\nAutumn Barnes, agronomy specialist with the Canola Council of Canada, said she is seeing quite a few crops with that problem in her areas south of the Trans-Canada Highway.\\n\\n“A lot of variable emergence issues this year, for sure,” said Barnes, “because it’s been so dry for the last 12 months plus. We were pretty low (in soil moisture) coming into the spring.”\\n\\nA canola crop walk hosted by Serfas Farms near Turin July 11 brought producers to survey a dryland crop with that very problem. The area has received only about 75 millimetres of precipitation since April and the crop in the host field, seeded May 2, averaged four plants per sq. foot. Seven to 10 plants per sq. foot is the preferred number.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“We’re probably showing you one of the more challenging fields,” said Serfas Farms field operations manager Alvin French.\\n\\nMany plants showed early stages of heat blast but even so, Kevin Serfas said the dryland canola looks better this year than it did last year, when extended hot temperatures drastically reduced yield.\\n\\n“The nights seem to be cooling down and that’s helping the crop at least hold on. We’re not waking up and its 20 degrees already at 8 o’clock in the morning.”\\n\\nSerfas said variable emergence looks to be a common problem. On a recent trip from Turin to Calgary, “unless you had irrigation, I was actually shocked to see how many fields looked as bad as mine does, if not worse.\\n\\n“But, what’s up is up. It would be really nice to get another inch of rain out here.”\\n\\nAfter first experimenting with pod shatter-resistant varieties two years ago, Serfas went all in this year and planted all fields to shatter-resistant types. That will allow him to wait longer for late bloomers to mature, then desiccate and straight-cut the crop.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“This year we decided just for simplicity and the fact that it’s just another tool that we have as farmers in our tool box, we decided to go 100 percent pod shatter (resistant). I think it’s going to turn out well for us.”\\n\\nBarnes said shatter-tolerant varieties could pay off, even those that have lower yield potential.\\n\\n“Especially in a year like this, if you’ve got a shatter-tolerant variety that maybe has a little bit less yield potential but it can hold onto those seeds, that’s yield right there.”\\n\\nBarnes said dry conditions in the south led to more herbicide issues in canola because less moisture means less biological activity in the soil. Purple, twisted growth points are the key indicators of herbicide injury.\\n\\nInsects have also been an issue, with more flea beetles than usual, which required more insecticide treatments. On the other hand, cabbage seedpod weevil levels were low and low moisture also means potential savings on fungicide.\\n\\n“Even though it has been dry down here, not to make light of it at all, but we are kind of limping along and we’re kind of hoping for the best come harvest,” said Barnes.',\n",

When they can’t mount a credible response to the science behind off-highway vehicle (OHV) restrictions, they turn to extreme and unfounded conspiracy theories about the conservation community.\\n\\nIt is classic displacement behaviour.\\n\\nThe latest in this absurd twisting of reality is the contention that Alberta’s conservation groups are green decoys, bent on radical, secretive social manipulation through deceptive land-use planning, which will lead to expulsion of all Albertans from the eastern slopes.

Not a single Dr. Strangelove bent on world domination in the bunch.\\n\\nMany, like me, are unpaid volunteers. Paid staff subsist on salaries significantly less than comparable positions in industry and government, often in the midst of areas with high costs of living.

For many imperiled species, working on an ecosystem basis, regardless of administrative or political boundaries, is good science.\\n\\nWhat limited outside funding is available is used to benefit conservation work in Alberta. Those funds are scrupulously documented with the Canada Revenue Agency and available for public review.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAOHVA’s whipped-up zeal to discredit the conservation community (and a legion of landowners, ranchers, hunters, anglers and hikers) is a concerted effort to de-legitimize the arguments for evidence-based decision making and for the greater public interest and values to be part of land-use planning and decisions.\\n\\nDisinformation techniques work for special interest groups like AOHVA on the principle that the amount of energy needed to refute the lies is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce them.\\n\\n“It is a proven fact that designed, engineered trail systems mitigate environmental concerns,” AOHVA says.\\n\\nYet, when asked for evidence, AOHVA points vaguely to an American group, the National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council. Its U.S. allies provide no answers and a search of the relevant literature shows only what Alberta’s chief scientist has already concluded: OHVs are hard on the environment. But AOHVA stubbornly sticks to its statement, perhaps hoping repetition can change reality.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhile attempting to portray the conservation community as some kind of green decoy for a dark conspiracy found only on the internet, AOHVA reveals itself as a muddy decoy group. Its much-vaunted four-point plan for environmentally responsible OHV use is meant to divert attention away from the immensity of OHV-related damage. It downplays the noise and displacement of other recreational users and represents the veiled purpose to intensify OHV use, as if there is no other value to public lands.\\n\\nAOHVA’s attempt to muddy the waters with a non-existent conspiracy is classic fear-mongering. Most Albertans will see it as a work of fiction and not be fooled by this muddy decoy group.\\n\\nLorne Fitch is a professional biologist, a retired Fish and Wildlife biologist and an adjunct professor at the University of Calgary.',\n",

Such a promise ignores the fact that agriculture is one of the most dangerous occupations in Canada, and that while fatality and injury numbers are dropping, they continue to be significant.\\n\\nAnd Kenney would do nothing about it, decrying the idea that government dares to try to address this: from 1997 to 2014, there were an average of 18.4 fatalities per year in Canada’s agriculture sector. An average of 3.5 children die per year in agriculture. About 70 percent of fatalities involve farm machinery (runovers and rollovers, which are preventable). Others involve animal related fatalities and crushing incidents.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nEducation and safety promotion have not done enough.\\n\\nSince the bill, called the Enhanced Protection for Farm and Ranch Workers Act, was enacted at the beginning of 2016, more than 1,800 workers compensation claims have been accepted.\\n\\nKenney has called the bill an “unnecessary attack on farmers.” He said, “what we hear from Alberta farmers loud and clear, not professional lobbyists but regular hardworking people in agriculture, is that this bill is a massive cost driver for them; it is unnecessary red tape.”\\n\\nReally? AgCoalition, the organization that worked with the government to determine the contents of the act, has 29 member organizations covering 97 percent of Alberta’s agriculture industry. Are these the professional lobbyists of which Kenney speaks?\\n\\nAlbert Kamps, chair of AgCoalition, said repealing the farm safety act would be “throwing out a lot of good with the bad.”\\n\\nThat is the loud and clear message that Kenney wants to ignore.\\n\\nWhile the Notley government bungled communications at first, it got its act together and launched extensive consultations with farm groups. The resulting regulations worked out reasonable compromises.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAgSafety, a farm agency with 26 member groups, will help deliver farm management tools and advice. Farmers can access these resources.\\n\\nThe law is largely aimed at protecting agricultural workers. The act requires every farm that employs outside workers to perform a hazard assessment.\\n\\nThe government will provide grants of up to $10,000 for producers who must modify equipment or provide safety training for workers.\\n\\nEven then, compromise on the bill was significant.

In fact, we know people will die whether or not it is repealed. The question is, will fewer people die or suffer injuries because of the provisions of this law. If that possibility exists, then the law is a worthy effort.\\n\\nNo law is perfect, but a major step was needed to enhance a culture of safety in agriculture.\\n\\nKenney’s stand fits with a party that sees government as a problem, rather than a solution. So be it. But a solution is needed to farm fatalities and injuries. And proper compensation must be accessible.\\n\\nKenney should drop his promise to repeal the act in favour of consultation with farmers after it’s been in place long enough for an objective assessment.\\n\\nKaren Briere, Bruce Dyck, Barb Glen, Brian MacLeod and Michael Raine collaborate in the writing of Western Producer editorials.',\n",

       "     'text': 'The discovery of genetically modified wheat growing in Alberta is disappointing and damaging to Canadian farmers.\\n\\nSo is the reaction by Cereals Canada, an industry-dominated group that falsely claims to represent Canadian wheat farmers.\\n\\nAn article published in 2014 quotes Cereals Canada President Cam Dahl saying, “Cereals Canada’s support for GM wheat is consistent with the policy of its member associations, which includes the Grain Growers, miller’s association and life science companies.”\\n\\nFollowing a GM wheat contamination incident in Oregon in 2014, Cereals Canada signed on to a statement in support of further investment in, and commercialization of, genetically modified wheat.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCereals Canada supported an irresponsible policy then and it hasn’t learned anything from Canada losing important markets now.\\n\\nEscapes of genetically modified plants and resulting market disruptions were predicted by the National Farmers Union 15 years ago.\\n\\nJapan, which was the highest-priced market when the Canadian Wheat Board was marketing Canadian wheat, has stopped all shipments of Canadian wheat and flour. South Korea also suspended Canadian wheat imports for a short time and other countries may follow.\\n\\nIn June, 2003, an NFU media release highlighted the unacceptable risks of GM wheat, calling it BSE for grain farmers because of the consequences GM wheat could bring should it escape and cause market closures.\\n\\nFollowing this latest discovery, Cereals Canada and its members were quick to revert to the “it’s all safe” biotech industry mantra, which ignores the very real market problems.\\n\\nTherein lies one of the central problems with Cereals Canada — some of its board members are in a conflict of interest. For a life science company, passing up an opportunity to sell more chemicals or seed would contradict the company’s interests.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThere is no question that the policies of Cereals Canada members, such as the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association and Grain Growers of Canada, helped provide Monsanto and the government the cover they needed to seed experimental plots of GM wheat at secret and undisclosed locations 15 years ago.\\n\\nThe farmer-run Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) also recognized the marketing liability that GM wheat posed. The CWB stood up for the interests of Canadian farmers and our international customers who do not want GM wheat.\\n\\nNo doubt its firm opposition to GM wheat is another reason why members of Cereals Canada worked so hard to destroy the CWB. Clearly, Cereals Canada cannot be trusted to represent the interests of Canadian wheat farmers.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCereals Canada has worked against the interests of farmers on other issues, as well. By continually undermining the Canadian Grain Commission, and calling for U.S. grain to freely enter Canada and be commingled with Canadian grain, Cereals Canada promotes other irresponsible policies.\\n\\nRecently, Cereals Canada has embarked on a plan to merge with or take over the Canadian International Grains Institute. The farmer check-off money that helps support CIGI makes CIGI a target that is just too good to pass up. However, with the mission statement “to be the trusted, independent source for milling, quality and end-use functionality expertise for millers and end-users of Canadian grain,” CIGI does important work and it would be extremely damaging to have CIGI taking the same irresponsible policy positions endorsed by Cereals Canada.\\n\\nGiven its track record, Cereals Canada has no right to a merger or takeover of CIGI.\\n\\nStewart Wells was president of the National Farmers Union from 2001-09.',\n",

       "     'text': 'The price of farmland in Canada has roughly tripled over the past two decades, even after adjusting for inflation.\\n\\nDespite these gains, it’s worth being cautious any time an asset price turns skyward. Land prices have crashed before and nobody wants to be caught.\\n\\nTo gauge the future prospects for farmland, we should look at factors that have driven its meteoric rise:\\n\\nStronger commodity prices: After adjusting for inflation, Statistics Canada’s broad measure of agricultural prices has risen more than 20 percent since the mid-2000s amid growing global demand.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Solid productivity growth: Genetic innovations and the adoption of precision technologies have allowed farmers to reduce costs and squeeze ever more production out of a given acre.\\n\\nLow interest rates: Interest rates have been exceptionally low since the 2007-08 global financial crisis, which has made it economical to bid more for land.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all three of these factors and other agri-business irritants are turning against farmland prospects:\\n\\nOn the commodity pricing front, oversupply has abated within the past 12 months but remains burdensome.\\n\\nIn the recent past, farmers have been shielded by an exceptionally well-timed drop in the loonie. The loonie is expected to appreciate only gradually over the next few years, but it will still put increasing pressure on the Canadian agriculture sector as our export-dependent commodities become more expensive.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Rising interest rates. After a difficult decade, the Canadian economy has now largely recovered from the global financial crisis and the plunge in oil prices that began in 2014. With the economy near capacity, the Bank of Canada has already increased rates from a low of 0.50 percent last year to 1.25 percent today and is expected to reach a neutral 2.50 to 3.00 percent range in mid-2019. An unexpected uptick in inflation could spur even higher rates. Rising interest rates will raise financing costs, weighing on farm earnings and, potentially, land prices.\\n\\nGeopolitical and trade issues often use agriculture as bargaining chips to enhance other agenda items, which creates uncertainty for producers and investors.\\n\\nIt is also possible that land prices have been pushed beyond justifiable levels by buyers hoping to replicate past gains. This can occur in any rapidly advancing market and raises the risk that land prices could drop sharply if deteriorating conditions triggered a rush for the exit. This factor, in our view, will mean the difference between a pause in land value increases and an outright decline in land prices.\\n\\nGiven the forces at play, it appears unlikely that farmland’s recent strong value gains will be repeated any time soon.\\n\\nAs always, but especially at this stage in the cycle, BMO is emphasizing caution and making the following recommendations:\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Consider “what-if” scenarios: Hypothetical calculations can help producers understand how they would be affected by a drop in commodity prices, lower land prices, an increase in interest rates, or all three simultaneously.\\n\\nRe-evaluate balance sheets: The farm sector’s debt-to-asset ratio is in line with long-term norms, but is higher than before the 1980s farm crisis. Producers should ensure they are comfortable with their borrowing levels and, if not, could consider diverting earnings or divesting assets to reduce debt.\\n\\nReconsider maturities: Borrowers who are wary of rising interest rates may consider locking in a fixed rate. Variable-rate borrowing has been the winning choice over the past decade, but that may not be the case ahead.\\n\\nTake a long view: A decline in farmland prices would be far less consequential for producers who plan to hold and operate their land over the long term.\\n\\nJohn MacAulay is senior vice-president and divisional head for BMO Bank of Montreal’s prairies-central Canada division.',\n",

So this is not a tentative measure. The U.S. appears to be prepared to go all in to help its farmers during what may be a prolonged trade war. Whether such a move would fall within WTO rules is unclear.\\n\\nOn June 25, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who is known for his gentlemanly demeanour, published an opinion piece in U.S.A. Today under the headline, “Trump will protect farmers from China’s trade retaliation,” accusing China of all sorts of nastiness, with words such as “bully,” “stealing,” “predatory” and “theft.”\\n\\nThe U.S. plans to place 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods July 6. China says it will retaliate with tariffs on U.S. imports, including soybeans. Trump now says he is considering tariffs of up to $200 billion on Chinese goods.\\n\\nChina is a significant market for U.S. agricultural products, importing $14 billion in U.S. soybeans.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIn a news conference, Perdue said the CCC is a potential tool to support U.S. farmers. If that happens, it could warp world crop prices. The CCC spends much of its support on soybeans, corn and wheat. If those prices were to be driven down by the U.S. pouring as much as $30 billion into farm support, it could have a significant effect on Canadian farmers.\\n\\nFor perspective, total annual subsidies to the U.S. farmers are estimated to be about $20 billion. So the signal is clear: the U.S. is preparing to buttress its agriculture sector to go to war on trade.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has said Canada will help business hurt by the trade dispute should Trump levy debilitating tariffs, most prominently on the steel, aluminum and auto sectors.\\n\\nUnlike softwood lumber, in which the Canadian government has provided more than $860 million in support after the U.S. placed 20 percent tariffs on Canadian product last year, there was no help for Canadian cattle producers when the U.S. enacted country-of-origin legislation that is estimated to have cost producers up to $8 billion over the years that the legislation was in force.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThat can’t happen this time. Canada does not have a regime in place to help farmers in the manner that the U.S. does. There are various support programs, the most relevant being AgriStability, which is not designed to facilitate support for a trade war.\\n\\nIf the trade dispute erupts into a prolonged war, like the Trump administration, Canada must also go all-in. Senior levels of governments must support agriculture.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has already placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, hitting The European Union, Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nThe Western Producer recently published a story quoting a U.S. pork producer lamenting Mexico’s retaliatory tariffs headlined, “We are bleeding.”\\n\\nThe preference would be that the U.S. does not see Canada bleed, but if we do, we must be prepared to administer a transfusion, not a Band-Aid.\\n\\nKaren Briere, Bruce Dyck, Barb Glen, Brian MacLeod and Michael Raine collaborate in the writing of Western Producer editorials.',\n",

The markets, facing serious trade problems caused by the U.S. tariff impositions, look for any news to go lower.\\n\\nAmerican soybeans have recovered on good news with domestic crushing at record July levels and exports remaining strong, at the top end of the trade’s estimates and projections.\\n\\nMore important, exports were nearly double last year’s for the same week, but no news might be good enough to lift prices over the long haul. And for corn, technical issues such as the market seeing a 47 percent increase in the short positions to nearly 105,000 means that any day-to-day upside will be drastically limited.\\n\\nThe WASDE report cut the projected seasonal average for corn to US$3.80. Soybeans were down about 75 cents to $9.25 from a month earlier.\\n\\nBrennan Turner of the grain marketing business FarmLead said producers might not want to count out the commodity markets from going lower again, but on a week to week basis producers should be considering that the business is “resetting the playing field.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“We are experiencing an exploratory phase in the markets,” Turner said about where the grains and oilseeds have been going.\\n\\n“China is the new price setter. We knew that from what we have seen in flax, peas and (Canadian) wheat. Now it is showing up in all the markets.”\\n\\nHe said the $2 drop in soybeans in as many months over trade issues is something that the market fundamentals of supply and demand can’t predict or contain.\\n\\n“The markets aren’t really set up for this kind of uncertainty. (The trade) handles uncertainty by exiting the market,” said Turner.\\n\\n“Nothing has changed about the demand and the use; just who will supply it to whom,” he said.\\n\\nWheat made big gains last week, but early this week those were handed back, dropping July 16 by 8.5 cents on September hard red winter to $4.84 and 7.5 cents on Minneapolis spring wheat to $5.28.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nOn the use side, Turner suggests that the industry might be focused on a trade war when they should be taking a longer view of what the Chinese consumer is thinking about.\\n\\n“There are some important factors such as slowed growth (in the economy) and high housing prices that are creating some public issues in that country, not unlike the situation in the U.S. in 2007,” he said.\\n\\nArlan Suderman of INTL FCStone also suggests that the market needs to try to look beyond the international trade disputes.\\n\\nWhile the USDA’s crop conditions reports are suggesting that there is a record soybean and corn crop on the way, he isn’t convinced, but that is also putting downward pressure on prices.\\n\\nDry and wet regions of the U.S. Midwest will likely temper the yields, and unless the rest of the month and August turn mild, yields will likely be lower than projected and could sway markets higher.',\n",

       "     'text': 'REGINA — Traders and analysts believe red lentil prices have bottomed out but greens still have a ways to go.\\n\\nVishal Vijay, head of business development with Agrocorp International, doesn’t think red lentil prices will fall below current levels of 15 to 15 1/2 cents per pound.\\n\\n“This is getting pretty close to the bottom of the bucket,” he told delegates attending the 2018 Pulse and Special Crops Convention.\\n\\n“I don’t think we’re going to see it drop too far below this.”\\n\\nChuck Penner, analyst with LeftField Commodity Research, agrees and is forecasting a gradual price appreciation during the second half of the 2018-19 crop year despite a large crop on the way.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCanadian farmers planted 3.8 million acres of lentils this spring, a 14 percent reduction from the previous year.\\n\\nHowever, production is forecast at 2.4 million tonnes, which is only a five percent drop from last year due to a return to average yields.\\n\\nPenner forecasts 1.4 million tonnes of reds in addition to 762,000 tonnes of carry-in, for a bulky total supply of 2.17 million tonnes.\\n\\nBut he also forecasts a robust 1.28 million tonnes of exports, up from 900,000 tonnes in 2017-18.\\n\\nHe believes India will return to the market in the latter half of 2018-19 and that low prices will stimulate increased demand from markets like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Mexico has also emerged as a new buyer of Canadian lentils.\\n\\nAnd there will be less competition from Australia due to a smaller crop in that country. Growers are expected to harvest 385,000 tonnes of reds, down 17 percent from 2017-18.\\n\\nCanadian carryout is forecast at 462,000 tonnes, down 300,000 tonnes from the current crop year.\\n\\n“That’s still not tight but it’s a little less cumbersome,” said Penner.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nVijay was skeptical of Penner’s production estimate. Agrocorp is forecasting one million tonnes of reds.\\n\\nBut he too believes India could be back in the lentil market in 2018-19 because it appears the country will have a 250,000 to 300,000 tonne shortfall of supply.\\n\\nVijay said there is considerable interest in Canadian lentils at today’s prices but buyers are holding off over concern about a rumour that the Indian government may raise the lentil import tariff to 60 percent from 40 percent.\\n\\nPenner wasn’t nearly as optimistic about the outlook for green lentils. Farmers planted 1.73 million acres and are expected to harvest the biggest crop in five years.\\n\\nHe forecasts 1.04 million tonnes of production and 1.11 million tonnes of total supply.\\n\\nUnfortunately, green lentil demand is static, so exports will be about 695,000 tonnes, which is similar to 2017-18.\\n\\nCarryout is expected to blossom to 313,000 tonnes, up from 48,000 tonnes in the current crop year.\\n\\nThat means green lentil prices are likely to drift down toward where red lentil prices are today, he said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIt doesn’t help that the United States is expecting a big green lentil crop as well.\\n\\nTim McGreevy, chief executive officer of the USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council, said growers planted 789,000 acres of mostly medium green lentils this spring, down 29 percent from last year.\\n\\nHowever, production is forecast at 400,000 tonnes, an 18 percent increase over last year. Timely rains have vastly improved the fate of this year’s crop over last-year’s drought-ravaged harvest.\\n\\nMcGreevy said the U.S. green lentil crop will be competing with Canadian green lentils in many of the same markets.',\n",

Those countries have steadily increased flax production over the last three years and are wooing Chinese buyers, which will limit gains for Canadian flax.\\n\\nHowever, the push for healthier diets from a growing middle class in China will continue to pressure supplies, he said.\\n\\nThompson said the crop in the ground has started off well, although most plants could use a nice rain. He cautioned that the recent hot spell will have to ease soon.\\n\\n“The crops are not doing so well these last few days to a week, with the 30-plus or close to 30-degree days,” he said earlier this month.\\n\\nTurner added that he’s heard concerns about the reliability of the U.S. market because that’s where a lot of the Canadian crop usually goes. However, the supply-demand fundamentals remain positive, he added.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHe said this year’s seeded acreage estimate marks a 29 percent decline from the five-year average.\\n\\nThompson said that number includes the highly successful peak year of 2014, when farmers seeded 1.605 million acres. The numbers have come down steadily since.\\n\\n“We’d like to hit that high again.”\\n\\nMany farmers saw strong prices the previous year, and flax seemed like a good economic decision. Two years later, lentils became the darling and flax acres fell to 941,387.\\n\\n“More people grew lentils that year, purely based on the expected profit,” Thompson said.\\n\\nLately, he said acreage has remained relatively steady and most of the present change is due to Manitoba acres shifting into soybeans. Saskatchewan and Alberta have remained roughly steady.',\n",

He said tariffs don’t necessarily have to be in place for governments to act and it’s possible that importers in China have received direction to look outside the U.S. for purchases this year, given the trade skirmishes between the two countries.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nDahl credited some of the increase in wheat exports to the high-quality crop, but some is due to politics, he said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh imported 1.028 million tonnes of wheat, an increase of 49.8 percent from the 685,800 tonnes it took in 2016-17.\\n\\nTop buyer Japan imported 1.328 million tonnes of wheat so far this crop year, compared to 1.307 million tonnes in the same period in 2016-17.\\n\\nWheat exports to all destinations are up 14.6 percent overall year over year, posting 13.616 million tonnes, compared to 11.881 million tonnes at the end of May in the 2016-17 crop year.\\n\\n“At this point, I wouldn’t want to make long-term trend predictions just based on this year and given the political uncertainty that is without question influencing trade flows,” Dahl said.\\n\\nThe exception to that rule is in Latin America. Colombia has upped its wheat imports, taking 1.009 million tonnes of wheat, compared to 881,100 tonnes the year previous, an increase of 14.5 percent.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nDahl attributed that to strong marketing efforts being carried out throughout the region and he sees sustained export growth possible for all of Central and South America.\\n\\nIn barley, exports to all destinations are at 1.731 million tonnes as of the end of May for the 2017-18 crop year. That compares to 1.026 million tonnes for the same period a year ago, an increase of 69.26 percent.\\n\\nChina and Japan are behind most of the increase, with China increasing its barley imports by 99 percent year over year, taking 1.573 million tonnes, compared to 790,300 tonnes as of May in the 2016-17 crop year.\\n\\nIn same period, Japan imported 101,500 tonnes compared to 44,600 tonnes in the year previous, which marks an increase of 127.6 percent.\\n\\nCanola exports are down slightly overall at 8.754 million tonnes for 2017-18 compared to 9.369 million tonnes as of May 2016-17.\\n\\nChina is importing the largest share of that with 3.634 million tonnes compared to 3.354 million tonnes in 2016-17.

Nobody is in the driver’s seat, but the machine stops. It senses he’s there.\\n\\nHe then decides to get out of the tractor’s way. The machine notices he’s no longer there and carries on with business, moving forward.\\n\\n“We went around this field three or four times already and it’s working really, really well,” he said of his tractor.\\n\\nTischler was demonstrating the autonomous machine for the first time in Lacombe, Alta. at canolaPALOOZA in late June.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIt’s controlled much like a remote-controlled car. Using the AgOpenGPS program on a tablet or computer, the software can control auto-steer and tilt, as well as functions to turn the seeder or sprayer on and off.\\n\\nFarmers can use the program with many existing GPS systems. It connects with what’s called an arduino, essentially a mini controller, over wireless technology, communicating GPS co-ordinates and speed.\\n\\nAs well, the machine is equipped with LIDAR (light detection and ranging), meaning it automatically stops if it notices an obstacle or person in front of it. As well, if all the signals, like ones that control steering or braking, aren’t transmitting to the tractor, it automatically stops.\\n\\n“The number one thing is safety because the thing could kill you immediately,” Tischler said.\\n\\nEven though it’s fairly safe, he said there are still a few kinks that make autonomous technology challenging.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nFor example, when he was testing his tractor autonomously on 3,000 acres on his farm near Mannville, Alta., it couldn’t spot things like deer antlers, which can be problematic. As well, it couldn’t turn at the same speed or go down a side hill when it was raining.\\n\\n“It’s cool 99.9 percent of the time, where we just sit in the cab and let it do its job,” he said. “That 0.1 percent, however, where it’s not working as well as it should, is really important. It goes back to safety.”\\n\\nDuring his demonstration, he said many farmers weren’t sure what to ask because the technology is new and seems foreign.\\n\\n“There’s a lot of awe because it’s so freaky,” he said.\\n\\nThe AgOpenGPS software is free to install. Tischler said he wants to expand the community, adding that many people are now using it. Some of them are also answering other people’s questions about it online on Combine Forum.\\n\\n“I now don’t have to answer everything as that community grows and gains that understanding and experience,” he said. “We’re all still learning.”\\n\\nHe said it’s exciting to see other people use the technology, even if they only just want to make a tailgate open and close.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“It’s really cool to see that because it shows more people are interested,” he said.\\n\\nAgOpenGPS can be downloaded from GitHub at bit.ly/2HS2trz.\\n\\nVideo tutorials on the program can also be found on Tischler’s YouTube channel at bit.ly/2FhTn8O.',\n",

       "     'text': 'HANOVER, Germany — This Brazilian-built self-propelled multitasking applicator may sound new, but it’s actually a melding of two existing machines — a granular spreader and a liquid sprayer — with a new pneumatic seeder for cover crops thrown in for good measure.\\n\\nIntroduced two years ago by Brazilian manufacturer Stara, the hybrid Imperador 3 has evolved to meet the demands of South American farmers who are renowned for extracting the most out of their machinery investment.\\n\\n“There is nothing like it in the world,” says the company’s marketing materials.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe claim is probably true because, depending on terrain, the Imperador can cover up to a quarter section per hour while spraying, spreading granular fertilizer or blowing on seed for cover crops.\\n\\n“With a single switch you can reset the machine to another duty in minutes,” said Felipe Willers, Stara’s international sales manager.\\n\\nHe said the machine’s design is appropriate for locations where farmers grow two crops a year but also for very short season single crop regions.\\n\\n“In the same day we shift from spraying in the crop for weeds and then move to spreading fertilizer in another crop and back to spraying,” Willers said.\\n\\n“It might not even be time for lunch yet some days.”\\n\\nWillers brought the big multi-tasker to Germany for the Agritechnica show last fall.\\n\\nThe unique machine is the result of marrying the popular Imperador sprayer to the also-popular Hercules fertilizer spreader. In the new hybrid version, the polyethylene liquid tank holds 635 U.S. gallons. The stainless steel granular tank holds 6,600 pounds, or three cubic metres, plus it has double-slide gates and a rubber conveyor.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nSpray boom length, fertilizer spread width and cover crop seeding width are available in either 88-foot or 99-foot models. This ensures the same tracks are followed in all three modes. The boom is centred in the middle of the wheelbase so that it’s more stable working in rough terrain.\\n\\n“The centre boom design is unique to us. We are the only ones to use it this way. It means we are stable over a lot of (variable terrain),” said Willers, which might be inspired by the rolling country and tight fields of Brazil’s most southern state, where the machine is built.\\n\\nWeight distribution is 50-50 fore and aft when spraying and 44 percent front and 56 percent rear when spreading.\\n\\nThe implement includes all the latest mapping, autosteer, Bluetooth communications, section control and other systems found on North American implements.\\n\\n“We build all of our systems ourselves,” Willers said in Hanover.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“We get the latest in technology that the market can provide, but we build it into our guidance and (controllers), the whole machine, that way the farmer doesn’t feel as though the Stara is made up of a collection of parts and pieces.”\\n\\nWhere the Imperador differs from North American high clearance self-propelled machines is the ability to raise and lower the entire chassis by 16 inches by turning a knob in the cab. This is in addition to normal boom height adjustment. The up and down option gives growers the opportunity to apply late-season nitrogen in taller corn or late-season crop protection products.\\n\\nThe third Imperador function, cover crop seeding, is enhanced by the additional chassis lift because it allows for seeding of cover crops into standing crops.\\n\\nFor normal boom height adjustment without the up and down option, the 88-foot boom has a range of 23 to 80 inches adjustable from the cab. On the 99-foot model without the up and down feature, normal range is 31 to 89 inches.\\n\\nThe Stara website says the pneumatic seeding function is able to uniformly distribute seed across the entire width of either the 88-foot or 99-foot boom.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAt the low end of ground speed and high end of seed volume, the pneumatic seeder dispenses up to 65 kilograms per acre at a ground speed of four km-h. At the speedy end of its performance, the seeder dispenses 20 kg per acre at a ground speed of 26 km-h. These tests were conducted with black-oat seed.\\n\\nThe Imperador is driven through a load sensing hydraulic pump by a 205 horsepower MWM turbo diesel. The hydrostatic four-wheel-drive machine can work on terrain with grades up to 32 percent. The supply pump is rated at 290 gallons per minute, filling the tank in less than three minutes.\\n\\nAn external wash system doesn’t require chemical bottles to be opened. The triple-function version with the seeder was introduced for this spring and can be added to existing bi-functional units.\\n\\nThe Imperador 3 is sold in South America, Europe and Africa but not in North America.\\n\\n“I can tell you it has been talked about but not happened so far,” said Willers.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Take one telehandler, two helpers and 42 minutes out of your busy schedule to change the 1,400-gallon liquid tank over to the 330 cubic foot granular tank on your liquid/dry applicator.\\n\\nIt’s all in the playbook for the Trident 5550 liquid and dry, single chassis combination applicator, according to Case IH. The company says the Trident, which was engineered from the ground up and introduced a year ago, is the industry’s fastest converting combination applicator on a dedicated chassis.\\n\\nThe engine and drive train constitute the most expensive part of any self-propelled farm implement, which is why single chassis combo applicators are gaining grower’s attention. The financial investment is spread out if all liquid and dry applications from early spring through late fall can be handled by the same power unit. The fact that the switch can be completed so quickly reduces the risk that field operations might suffer from time delays.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhile some dual-duty applicators are basically dry units with liquid added, or liquid units with dry added, the news release says, “number one on the priority list for Case IH was to design a true combination applicator from the ground up. Other so-called combination applicators simply are adaptations of an existing spray rig or other application equipment. The Trident 5550 gives producers and commercial applicators a single piece of equipment to meet the demands of fertilizer and crop protection applications.\\n\\n“Since the new chassis can carry liquid or dry application systems, it requires a suspension package capable of carrying high-capacity loads and applying those loads over a wide range of speeds. The new load-compensating suspension features a pneumatic cylinder at each suspension joint to help maintain ride quality and load levelling. An engine-powered air compressor supplies air to the cylinders, which automatically adjust according to operating mode and load weight.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe Trident 5550 is powered by a 390 horsepower, 8.7 litre engine that puts out 415 h.p. peak at 2000 r.p.m. Fuel capacity is 150 U.S. gallons with 21 gallons of diesel exhaust fluid. The Trident has hydrostatic four-wheel-drive with an in-cab speed control knob that lets the operator infinitely adjust speed. It maintains correct load and speed ratios in all conditions. When introduced, Trident was the industry’s first applicator with factory-available duals in row crop tire sizes. The new design lets the operator adjust track width setting in half-inch increments from the cab, without stopping.\\n\\nAll technology available on other Case liquid and dry applicators is available on the Trident 5550, including the most advanced Case IH Advanced Farming Systems AccuBoom automatic boom section control, AutoBoom automatic boom height control and AccuGuide autoguidance.\\n\\nTrident features AIM Command FLEX advanced spray technology. This technology delivers precise product flow and spray pressure to eliminate over-application and under-application. It also features turn compensation for accurate application across the boom, around corners and on contours. An automated rinse is available as an option.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nProducers can order the optional New Leader NL4500T G4 Edge variable rate dry nutrient applicator, which provides a high level of precision dry-product application with precision spinner technology. New Leader spreads dry product faster, wider and more consistently. The Case release says its MultiApplier option allows application of two dry products simultaneously or independently at straight or variable rates in one pass. The MultiBin option gives the farmer four products in a single pass.\\n\\nTo accomplish the big switch, engineers developed an aerial frame with lifting points to help lift each applicator evenly, whether it’s the Liquid System with a 90 or 120 foot boom or the variable rate dry nutrient applicator. Each applicator has a different weight balance, requiring some adjustment to the aerial lift device to ensure it can squarely lift either applicator.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhen removing the dry applicator, the first step is to remove all mechanical fasteners. You must remove the four spring-loaded eye bolts plus four stretch bolts on each side at the rear of the chassis. Keep the eye bolts, but discard the stretch bolts. Case supplies a special slide hammer to remove the pucks between the metal plates at the rear of the chassis. The dry applicator is now mechanically unhooked from the chassis.\\n\\nFor both applicators, there’s a common centralized location for all hydraulic lines and electrical fittings beneath the bed at the midway point of the chassis. These are all quick-couplers, so no tools are necessary to disconnect them. The applicator is now ready to come off the chassis. The dry applicator has eyelet connections to connect to aerial lift chains. An overhead hoist, telehandler, shop crane or anything capable of lifting up to 12,000 pounds can be used for the lift.\\n\\nWhen the dry applicator has been safely set on the ground, the lifting point of the aerial device must be readjusted to accommodate the liquid system. This involves sliding the metal collar with a turnbuckle either fore or aft, depending on which applicator needs to be lifted.\\n\\nAt this point in the process, the liquid applicator can be chained to the aerial lift device and placed onto the Trident chassis. The same pucks removed from the dry system are installed, along with new stretch bolts, which are available in a changeover kit from a local Case IH dealer. The kit contains all hardware needed for the next step. Attach the four spring-loaded eye bolts to the liquid system, check and torque the new stretch bolts. The liquid system is now mechanically fastened.\\n\\nConnecting hydraulic lines is the next step. Identical sized hoses are used, but couplers for liquid and dry attachments have female and male electrical connections so they cannot be hooked up incorrectly. Finally, if the liquid unit has a front-fill option, the hose will need to be connected with the plumbing underneath the tank.',\n",

The auger can dispense a full hopper of two-inch diameter rock in less than 35 seconds, unloading to either the left or right side.\\n\\nDanuser’s idea is that the same bucket that mixes and augers feed into the troughs in the morning can mix and pour concrete in the afternoon and then be hosed out in time for the afternoon feeding.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe implement, which Danuser designed for skid steer loaders and small front-wheel-assist tractors, is built with integral cutting edges so it doesn’t need to have the load dumped in. It can scoop into sand, gravel, feed grain, silage, dry topsoil, sawdust and a variety of other materials.\\n\\nMega Mixer is available with an all-steel auger or a rubber flighted auger for wet materials. It comes standard with dual safety grates.\\n\\nThe unit features a bag buster, lockable discharge gate, click-pin holders and laser cut yardage markers that are easy for the operator to see.\\n\\nEach Mega Mixer includes two 24-inch multi-link chutes that store conveniently on the bucket. Additional chutes are available with chain mounting holes for stronger support. A lockable discharge flap limits spilling and allows for faster material mixing. A recent factory notice states that the Mega Mixer is not intended for mulching.\\n\\nDanuser introduced the Mega Mixer last fall. The company’s Kurt Schellenberger said a large number of the machines have been sold to farmers.\\n\\nIn Canada, Mega Mixer and other Danuser products are available from Adair Sales and Marketing in Swift Current, Sask.

They need more water as temperatures rise past 27 C.\\n\\nCattle on grass that have direct access to a dugout gain an average of 2.14 pounds per day whereas those receiving well water can gain 2.67 lb. per day.\\n\\nWhite rings around a dugout or other water body indicate high sulfates, said Nathan Erickson of the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon. These conditions are common in Saskatchewan.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCattle can adapt to the water but there are limits as to how much they can tolerate.\\n\\n“Cattle will develop a tolerance over time and they will adapt to high-sulfate water, so what may be poor water in one region may be acceptable in another region,” he said at the University of Calgary veterinary summit held June 19-21.\\n\\nDuring wet years, there is movement of salts from the soil to the water. Salt concentration in water increases faster than it can equalize during hot weather with extreme evaporation.\\n\\n“During dry periods, which is normal for Western Canada, we are going to have a buildup of salts that are going to move from the water to the soil and move back and forth,” he said.\\n\\n“Over time, this should start to equalize in areas around the water but it takes quite a bit of time for that to happen,” he said.\\n\\nWater with high-sulfate levels also affects copper absorption rates. Cows younger than 10 years are likely to not get pregnant if they suffer from a copper deficiency.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWater quality can be assessed by a laboratory or by using electrical conductivity to measure the salts. However, tests are expensive.\\n\\nLast year, more than 300 cattle died suddenly after drinking contaminated water at a community pasture near Shamrock, Sask.\\n\\n“We need to make sure that we remember this from our day-to-day production and build up that memory within our producers.

       "     'text': 'Most livestock producers agree castration, branding, dehorning and difficult calving cause animals pain, but most producers do not use pain treatments to take the edge off.\\n\\nRecent survey results show about a third of producers use pain control for dehorning. However, many say they dehorn when the calves are very young or use a polled bull to eliminate removing horns, said Tracy Herbert of the Beef Cattle Research Council.\\n\\nThirteen percent said they use pain medication for castration and the majority said they do it before three months of age, she told the University of Calgary veterinary summit held in Calgary June 19-21.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAt Tamara Carter’s family ranch in southwestern Saskatchewan, pain medication at their commercial Angus operation has been a normal practice for five years. In 2013, their veterinarian told them Metacam could be used for castration and branding.\\n\\nThey started using it on all steer calves and noted improved animal welfare, as well as better weight gains.\\n\\n“There has been no downside. The results were so quick and impressive to see those baby calves right back up, nursing and bonding with mom or not flicking tails and not exhibiting any discomfort,” she said at the Calgary conference.\\n\\nShe has compared weaning weights on calves from the pre-pain-control days to current results and found calves have added an extra 100 pounds each since 2011.\\n\\n“We have spent about $2,100 on Metacam in the last five years and I would estimate the increasing gains added $120,000 to $150,000. Where else would you get that rate of return,” she said.\\n\\nWhile the beef code of practice dictates calves older than six months should receive medication for painful procedures, the greater challenge was finding approved products.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nRecently a pour-on banamine from Merck Animal Health has received approval in Canada, Europe and the United States.\\n\\nIn Canada, the local anesthetic lidocaine is available and meloxicam is approved for pain.\\n\\nCanadian researchers have just completed a five-year project testing products for castration and spaying pain. There are few validated diagnostic techniques and pain-scoring systems for beef cattle, said Agriculture Canada researcher Karen Schwartzkopf-Genswein.\\n\\nAdditionally, any products on the market have to be easy to use.\\n\\n“In order for something to be adopted by the industry, it has to be practical or it is not going to happen,” she said.\\n\\nIn the course of their research, obvious signs of pain, such as facial expressions, head drooping, arched back or tail-flicking were used to assess pain. Often, these observations were criticized as too subjective so they also measured cortisol in saliva and hair, monitored temperatures and measured feeding behaviour.\\n\\nThe study concentrated on the effects of band and knife castration at different ages of cattle and compared pain reactions without pain relief and with approved drugs like meloxicam.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThey noted as calves get older, cortisol levels increase when they are castrated surgically with a knife.\\n\\nOne- and two-week-old calves castrated with a knife had scrotal swelling for seven days compared to four-month-old calves, which experienced swelling for 14 days.\\n\\nOne-week and two-month calves castrated with an elastic band had scrotal swelling for 21 and 28 days, respectively, while the four-month-old calves had swelling for 35 days.\\n\\nThe older they are, the longer it takes to heal and the more painful it appears to be.\\n\\n“Based on this study, I am going to recommend band castration at two months of age and less,” said Schwartkopf-Genswein.\\n\\n“Band- and knife-castrated calves show indicators of acute pain regardless of their age,” she said.\\n\\nMeloxicam reduced physiological and behavioural indicators of pain among week-old calves.\\n\\nPain and stress response is additive for multiple procedures like castration and branding.\\n\\n“Meloxicam was equally effective at reducing pain caused by a combination of activities like castration and branding versus castration alone,” she said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThere was no added benefit of giving meloxicam three or six hours before castration. Giving it at the time of the procedure works is probably preferable.\\n\\nThey also tried a combination of meloxicam and lidocaine during surgical castration. Lidocaine was injected into the neck of the scrotum 30 minutes before castration.\\n\\nThey expected that the combination of those drugs would be better but they did not see that during the experiments.\\n\\n“There were no combined effects of the meloxicam and lidocaine. However, if you look to see when the effects occurred, we think it provides longer-lasting pain relief because they act at different time points,” she said.\\n\\nThey are starting to assess pain relief when spaying heifers with collaborators from the University of Saskatchewan, Thompson Rivers University, University of Calgary and Agriculture Canada.\\n\\nSpaying can be done through the flank or vaginally. It requires skill to perform and could cause trauma, hemorrhaging or death. It has been assumed spaying was not painful, but early results show it is.\\n\\nA combination of butophanol, ketamine and xylazine followed up with Metacam was tried with promising results.\\n\\nPain control had many benefits but weight or average daily gain was never improved.\\n\\n“In the 10 years we have been doing this kind of work, I have never seen a weight response for any of the drugs we used. Compensatory gain happens,” said Schwartzkopf-Genswein.',\n",

For him, it’s been a profitable venture.\\n\\n“There has been good money in it,” said Sweetnam, who owns Glengary Bison with his wife, Cynthia Austin, near Madden.\\n\\nThe couple raise about 40 head on prairie grasses only. The females are routinely sold as breeding stock to other farmers looking to get into the business. The males are produced for pet food, and for meat sold directly to consumers and restaurants.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“I haven’t killed one female,” he said, noting their meat is fattier. “Lots of people don’t want fat for various reasons. Personally, I want to live until I’m 120, so I don’t want a lot of fat in my diet.”\\n\\nFor the animals that are processed, however, he uses every part of it.\\n\\nFor instance, the ribs are used as dog bones, the skulls have been sold to artists, and the organs are used to make pet food. The higher-quality cuts are used to make products such as sausages, burgers, steaks, roasts, and short ribs.\\n\\n“It’s been very good for us,” he said.\\n\\nSweetnam, originally from Scotland, moved to Alberta in 1968. He had experience raising Black Angus in Scotland, but soon began helping a producer in Bergen, Alta. with his bison operation.\\n\\nHe managed to find suitable land to start his own herd in 1997. He ventured across Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Montana and Wyoming to learn about different breeds.\\n\\nHe looked for bison that had high meat potential, as well as favourable temperament.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“I want to see a long back, a big ass and I don’t want fighters,” he said. “I’ve had 98 people for tours and not one of those animals were aggressive, so they’re used to people.”\\n\\nHe said good sales and relatively low operating costs have allowed him to be profitable. Austin also runs a horse training program on the side.\\n\\n“This bison industry sort of subsidizes her hobby,” Sweetnam joked.\\n\\nHe said demand for bison is growing as consumers become more health conscious.\\n\\nHe finds there is a market for bison meat where the animals are not treated in the same manner as beef.\\n\\n“I have nothing against beef, but some people, including me, don’t want growth hormones or steroids,” he said. “Raising bison takes a lot longer but your quality is better as far as I’m concerned.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Q: What an ordeal this has been. For the past 13 years, ever since my dad died, my mom has been living alone in the little house she and Dad bought when they sold the farm and moved into town.\\n\\nMom has always been fiercely independent. Unfortunately, that is not working for her any more.\\n\\nAll of her medical problems are adding up and making it impossible for her to continue living on her own.\\n\\nWe have tried explaining this to her but she does her best not to understand.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nFinally, my husband put his foot down and moved Mom into a long-term care facility not far from us and not that far from her little house.\\n\\nShe has a great little suite there with lots of room for her memorabilia and comfortable furniture.\\n\\nBut she is not co-operating. She has thrown out most of her precious memories (we rescued her beautiful wedding picture), complained to anyone who would listen how we had betrayed her, and so far, has refused to mix and mingle with the other residents, even though many of them had been neighbours when she and Dad were on the farm.\\n\\nIs there anything that we can do to help both her and us get through this difficult time?\\n\\nA: Your mom has likely just had an epiphany. Unlike those about which you read while browsing through the spiritual shelf in the bookstore, epiphanies are not always positive.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIn your mother’s case, what she is discovering is that despite her self-determination, her tremendous courage, her personal strength, her fierce drive to independence and that overwhelming reflection of pride, she is going to spend the last part of her life where she most likely does not want to be.\\n\\nShe knows, maybe what you have not quite figured out — that the average age for admission to long-term care facilities is higher than it used to be.\\n\\nPeople admitted for care are in more need of assistance than were those in the past, that people living in long-term care facilities will not live as long as they used to live and that despite the good intentions and support from the staff in the facilities, a number of residents living there are in fear of being abandoned by their families. That is a powerful epiphany, one most likely driving your mom into moments of irritability, depression, and grief and loneliness.\\n\\nThe temptation for many people in your mom’s position is to check in with their family doctors for prescriptions to counter balance their emotional challenges. Perhaps that too will be the ultimate outcome for your Mother. But before you go that route, I suggest that you spend as much time with Mom as you can.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nDon’t argue with her. Don’t try to convince her that the long-term care facility is best for her (even if it is).\\n\\nIn fact, don’t say anything, or at least as little as possible, unless of course you are sharing with her tidbits from the lives of both her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. This is your time to listen to her.\\n\\nIt’s payback for all those times when she was there listening to you, changing your diapers when you were an infant, hugging you through your awkward times in elementary school, crying with you when your one and only boyfriend bit the dust, maybe even walking with you through your first divorce, and loving with you through the birth of your children.\\n\\nIf you listen to your mom properly, without judgment, without trying to correct her when she is in error, she will make her own way in her new facility.\\n\\nRemember, it is not necessarily the place that is bad. What is bad is her disappointment in herself. As she comes to terms with her own disappointment, she will find her own way into her new life and, who knows, maybe your visits with her there can be fun.\\n\\nJacklin Andrews is a family counsellor from Saskatchewan.

Several rules that had caused concerns in farming circles have been publicly released. For instance, farmers will be able to use or sell old equipment if it’s not up to the latest manufacturer code, and won’t need to wear a seatbelt if they are driving slow or taking other safety precautions.\\n\\nAs well, the rules state that workers can be raised and lowered in a loader bucket in the rare case that machines can’t be used for that purpose. It also said fall protection devices may not be practical, though rollover assessments must be completed for equipment weighing over 700 kilograms.\\n\\nThe province pushed ahead with the rules in an effort to strike a balance between keeping farm workers safe while ensuring operators can abide by them.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“The overarching goal is creating a safety culture on farms in Alberta, and helping producers in making that happen on their farms,” Wacowich said.\\n\\nBefore moving to AgSafe, Wacowich worked with the Alberta Motor Transport Association (AMTA), helping people get comfortable with new rules that required them to adopt new practices when signing service contracts.\\n\\nShe said much of that work with the AMTA, where she got people to change their practices for the better, can be applied to her new role.\\n\\nAgSafe is in the process of developing a plan to determine what services to offer to help farms and ranches adjust. It’s currently running a pilot project that involves consultants going to farms and tailoring safety plans for each.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Vegetable farm in British Columbia’s Lower Mainland grows produce in fields and greenhouses on eight acres of land\\n\\nSURREY, B.C. — Hidden among the stylish cul de sacs in suburban Surrey, a thriving vegetable farm sits that has been in the Zaklan family for 90 years.\\n\\nFor the last six years, Doug Zaklan and Gemma McNeill have been farming eight acres of land growing a variety of vegetables in fields and greenhouses within the city.\\n\\nThey were nominees in British Columbia’s outstanding young farmer program.\\n\\nThe two met at the University of British Columbia where they were studying sustainable agriculture. Zaklan was involved in the university farm practicum program and she was pursing an agriculture degree.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhen they wanted to take over, the Zaklan family was supportive because it meant rebuilding a heritage farm that no one wanted to lose. Zaklan’s parents were teachers and the land had not been actively farmed for some time.\\n\\nThe original farm was a 20 acre parcel of newly cleared land bought by Zaklan’s great-grandparents in the 1920s. Part of it was sold off and was absorbed by the city. The farm is not protected by the provincial agriculture land reserve but the local municipality and neighbours support it.\\n\\nZaklan and McNeill farm an acre and a half for vegetables and greenhouses and also keep pasture chickens. While the older Zaklans are available to help, three extra people were hired for seeding, harvesting and greenhouse work.\\n\\n“We don’t have trouble finding staff because we are close to an urban centre. If you are young and interested in farming, we are a story of starting from nothing without any debt and I think that is inspiring for people,” Doug said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAdmitting they were somewhat naïve when they started, they worried throughout their first year whether they would be able to build a viable business.\\n\\nIt turned out to be a success and they have grown every year expanding production and becoming more efficient.\\n\\nThey have developed a seven-year crop rotation and upgraded the greenhouses with heated tables so they can start seedlings sooner.\\n\\n“If I started again it would be 50 percent greenhouse because you have a lot more control,” Zaklan said. They could also supply more vegetables in the winter and worry less about the weather.\\n\\n“We started small and each year we would look at past projects. Each year we got a little more productive and decided what is the one tool that would make us more productive. Over time, we haven’t had a lot of overhead and we don’t have a mortgage so we could take that money and invest it in the business,” he said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Our farm model is very much about efficiency. We want to be able to walk from the barn to the field with a maximum of 500 feet. If we had to get in the car and drive somewhere and haul an implement or fertilizer or irrigation pipes, it just wouldn’t make sense,” he said.\\n\\nNot having to pay a mortgage on the high-priced property is key.\\n\\n“We are really lucky because we are on family owned land. If we wanted to own land it would be nearly impossible,” McNeill said.\\n\\nFarm land in the Surrey area sells for about $100,000 per acre, which they argue discourages agriculture.\\n\\n“We are not going to be able to grow food. We have some of the best agriculture land in the county and what are we doing about it? It is really frustrating and demoralizing,” she said.\\n\\nThey are involved with a group that is helping young farmers link with those who have land available.\\n\\n“The new entrants in farming are not necessarily from farming backgrounds. People who are farming like we are, are coming from urban centres and don’t have land they are inheriting,” she said.\\n\\nMcNeill and Zaklan both studied agriculture, but they both had to learn how to adapt to local conditions for more production and efficiency.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThey follow organic standards but the farm is not certified.\\n\\nThey start seeding in mid March in the greenhouse and plugs are later transplanted into fields.\\n\\nThey buy seeds from many different sources and each year they set up small research plots to test new plants.\\n\\n“We are always looking for companies that are growing interesting cultivars. The restaurant industry has really pushed the frontier of something different,” McNeill said.\\n\\nTheir products are available from April to December and are sold to restaurants and through a community-shared agriculture project, in which they provide fruit and vegetables to 50 families for 20 weeks starting at the end of May.\\n\\n“As we figured out our marketing channels, we tailored our growing plans,” she said.\\n\\nHarvest starts early and this year they were picking peas on May 29 that were planted in the ground mid March.\\n\\nThey use drip irrigation and water is supplied by the city. However there are water limitations, so they do not have the capacity to irrigate more.\\n\\nBy the end of May, the fields were full of lettuces, carrots, garlic, onions, melons, peas, beans, kale, radishes and fababeans at various stages of growth.\\n\\nThe plants are thriving thanks to the recent purchase of a Japanese transplanter where each plant is evenly spaced in the rows so no thinning is required. They also use succession planting so crops are ready for longer throughout the growing season.\\n\\nThe couple is always exploring new ways of doing things, while keeping an eye on the bottom line.\\n\\n“It is a whole different way to look at ways to be more productive. Instead of trying to have larger fields or grow more, we are growing the right amount for when you need it rather than putting energy onto things that aren’t going to sell,” Zaklan said.\\n\\n“We experimented with a whole bunch of things and restaurants seem to be our niche. It suits our farm size and what we enjoy growing.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Alberta farmer recognized for his Tiregrabber entry at Canada’s Farm Progress Show competition in Regina\\n\\nNecessity is the mother of invention, according to the proverb, and farmer-inventors prove that true all the time.\\n\\nDarcy Goossen of Ferintosh, Alta. took his Tiregrabber to Canada’s Farm Progress Show last month, where the public voted it the top farmyard invention.\\n\\n“It’s a machine for handling big tires and putting them on and off sprayers, combines, machinery,” Goossen said.\\n\\n“We came up with the idea out of necessity for our own farm. We were handling big tires on two sprayers, and the forklift wasn’t cutting it any more.”\\n\\nHe said it took him about five years to get the product to the final version, which was completed last fall. The product was kept mostly under wraps until the patent process was finished.\\n\\n“We came up with something that we thought was pretty good, and since then it’s only improved with the help of good draftsmen and engineers,” Goossen said.\\n\\nThe Tiregrabber is a three-armed unit that attaches to a skid steer and handles large tires more safely.\\n\\n“We went to three (arms) because we thought it cradled it at the four o’clock and eight o’clock position underneath; in case the hydraulics release, it still had two arms underneath,” Goossen said.\\n\\nA turning plate on the back links the three arms together, and the tire is always centred on the main pivot point.\\n\\n“You can lay the tire down,” he said.\\n\\n“You drive up with a skid steer, grab the tire and stand it up, the tire is centred. It’s not trying to roll to one side.”\\n\\nGoossen said the machine offers farmers more protection because they don’t have to stand tires up, put a forklift underneath and hope the tire doesn’t fall over the other way.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe Tiregrabber can be mounted on different types of hydraulic equipment, lift up to 4,000 pounds and grab tires up to 88 inches across.\\n\\nAlthough he intended to just build a machine for his own farm, he said encouragement from those who knew what he was working on and the knowledge that all farms struggle to handle tires propelled him to another stage.\\n\\nHe said 25 units built in the home farm shop sold out so production moved to a welding shop and more than 40 more units have sold.\\n\\n“I’m really happy with it,” he said.\\n\\nHis people’s choice victory earned him a $5,000 gift card from Peavey Mart, which sponsors the Farmyard Invention competition.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nGoossen said his career as a “builder” likely began when he was a child and his parents bought Lego.\\n\\n“We built Lego for days,” he said.\\n\\n“As we got older, my dad was not a welder, so he bought an old buzz box and said, ‘you’re going to have to start building things’ because no one else was doing it on the farm.”\\n\\nAt age 14 he started building swings for his siblings and other people and moved on to seed drill movers.\\n\\n“Ten years ago, if someone had told me I’m going to get to a show and win a prize, it’s like, I don’t think you know what you’re talking about because that’s not me,” he said.\\n\\nStill, while his wife, sons and a hired man take care of the farm back home, Goossen is on the trade show circuit and has more project ideas.\\n\\n“My wife thinks I might be overloading and I’ve got too many ideas but …” he said, pausing.\\n\\nFor more information, visit thetiregrabber.com.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Farmers in northeastern Saskatchewan should stay alert for fusarium head blight, according to the province’s forecast map.\\n\\n“There are some other areas over by Hudson Bay and around the Melfort area that are high and that’s because they were wetter last year,” said Sherri Roberts, Saskatchewan Agriculture cropping management specialist for the southeastern region.\\n\\nView the complete fusarium head blight risk map here.\\n\\nWhile inoculum levels are higher in the northeast, the southeast moved from a low-level possibility to a moderate level over the past week.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Because we were so dry (last year) in a lot of the southeast, we’re still kind of sitting in that moderate range, although it could explode tomorrow if we keep getting (these) wet and humid conditions because inoculum will survive in the soil for two years,” she said.\\n\\nOats are the least susceptible cereal grain to fusarium, while corn is the most sensitive. With 100,000 acres, the southeast leads the province with the most corn acres.\\n\\n“A lot of it is forage corn, but their biggest problem is they’re growing it on the same acres over and over and over again, and then those fusarium levels just build up,” she said.\\n\\nHowever, many producers have been proactively spraying for fusarium, said Shannon Friesen, also from Saskatchewan Agriculture.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“(It’s) over in the east-central area, as well as the northeast, but there have been some producers on the west side of the province as well. Some see it as cheap insurance, especially because the conditions this year are a lot more conducive to having that humidity and some, of course, are spraying because their risk is higher than we saw last year,” she said.\\n\\nRoberts said southeastern Saskatchewan’s biggest problem this summer has been uneven germination.\\n\\n“Parts of the field will have started heading out already and then the rest of them, the flag leaf hasn’t come up yet. So, there’s a whole bunch of irregularity in the field and it makes timing of spraying really difficult,” she said.\\n\\n“Some of them are opting not to spray. Because the window is so large, they’re just throwing up their hands and saying, ‘well what happens, happens.’ ”\\n\\nRainfall in some areas such as Lampman, which received 250 millimetres over four days in early June, also hampered some producers from getting into their fields. Other producers wanted to reseed due to dry conditions but had to wait for fields to dry out.\\n\\n“We’ve got some cereal crops here maybe five, six inches high, so, if we don’t have a frost, we’re going to have a real long extended harvest down here,” Roberts said.\\n\\nFarmers should be out scouting and looking for the symptoms of fusarium, she said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThey should also be mowing grass around their field edges.\\n\\n“A lot of those brome grasses and weeds hold their seeds for a long time. And that flowering period, that provides an environment for the fusarium to get going and then it just has to shift into your field when your weeds starts to flower,” she said.\\n\\nFor many cereal crops, there’s still time to cut grass and control the spread of fusarium this year.\\n\\n“It all depends what stage their field is at because a lot of these younger fields out here haven’t come to head yet and fusarium can only infect the plants when they’re flowering,” she said.\\n\\n“If they get those field edges mowed, when their field finally does come into flowering, they will have cut down the chances of there being fusarium inoculum in the area.”\\n\\nContact william.dekay@producer.com',\n",

       "     'text': 'Some readers may remember the Western Grain Stabilization Administration (WGSA), a Prairie grain support program that ran from 1976 to 1989. Farmers could contribute up two per cent of net grain sales, matched two to one by the federal government. It was a pretty good deal, so most farmers participated.\\n\\nThe payout mechanism was simple — probably too simple. Money would be triggered when Prairie grain income fell below a running five-year average. It was possible that farmers in one area could have a drought and not get a payout because farmers in other areas had a bumper. Conversely, farmers with good crops might get a payment they didn’t need.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe WGSA proved inadequate to handle the combination of drought and a grain price war during the 1980s, so it was replaced by ad hoc payments and a series of different programs with four-letter acronyms.\\n\\nThe WGSA was cheap and easy to run with a small but dedicated and helpful staff. Hundreds of farmers with questions about their account were on a first-name basis with Omar Bilokury, the genial guy with all the answers, who passed away recently.\\n\\nThe other reason it was easy to run was that it worked in tandem with the wheat board permit book system — all board and non-board deliveries to licensed facilities had to be recorded. Most farmers wanted to be in the program, so if other facilities such as feed mills wanted their grain, they needed to submit sales to WGSA. As a result, there was public information on the overall prices farmers received.\\n\\nToday we don’t have that. That’s in contrast to the U.S., where USDA publishes a monthly list of actual prices received by farmers for products ranging from fruits and vegetables through nuts, livestock, grains and hay.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nBuyers report these prices to the USDA. For example, the most recent report says that in May, farmers in North Dakota received US$5.75 per bushel for spring wheat, $4.41 for malting barley, $3.35 for feed barley and $9.25 for canola. The USDA does withhold some information to ensure commercial confidentiality — for example if there is only one sunflower buyer in a state the source is obvious — but most is available.\\n\\nIt’s been six years since the end of the wheat board, which was supposed to mean that we’d have an open market like the one in the U.S., where the USDA also publishes export prices and other information such as vessels waiting in port.\\n\\nCanadian farmers are still waiting for similar information. The last Conservative government did finance the Alberta Wheat Commission’s PDQ system, which reports regional cash prices for wheat, canola and peas, based on reports from the elevator companies.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHowever, for wheat they use a voodoo system of subtracting their Canadian dollar cash price minus the U.S. futures in U.S. dollars — which is a positive number — and calling that the basis. Last week the companies were telling you they were paying $40 more than the Minneapolis futures. It’s hard to imagine that any farmers pay attention to this. (The weekly cash price report on our markets page converts the currencies to provide a more realistic figure.)\\n\\nOne way or another, these prices are just quotes, not what the companies actually pay. The real basis is the difference between the price on the driveway and the export price at ports, which only the exporters know, but they’re not telling. It would be unreasonable to require them to disclose individual sale prices, but they could report prices in such a way as to provide a realistic average.\\n\\nThere’s no technical reason why in Canada we can’t have the same information as in the U.S. We had it during WGSA, which was not quite pre-computers, but it was when they were as big as shipping containers and sales in small truckloads had to be reported from 3,000-plus elevators, not the 300 or so we have today.\\n\\nAs for export grain prices, AAFC already has market analysis staff who would be happy to collect them if they were given the authority.\\n\\nIf we could do it in the 1970s, we could do it now. The only thing missing is a government requirement to provide the information.\\n\\nThat would settle once and for all the question of whether elevator companies are paying fair prices, or making out like bandits.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Anyone worried about bertha army worm or diamondback moth will welcome the provincial trap counts so far.\\n\\nNeither pest has shown up in alarming numbers, according to both trap data and Manitoba Agriculture entomologist John Gavloski.\\n\\nNinety-three out of the province’s 99 bertha army worm traps currently sit at “low risk,” with less than 300 adult moths caught in each trap. The remaining six, all in western or central Manitoba, sit only a step higher on the province’s risk scale.\\n\\n“Basically, what it means is scout your field,” Gavloski said in a July 11 webinar. “When numbers get into that range, there’s the possibility of some localized issues. Usually, if things stay in that range, we’re not looking at widespread issues.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCumulative trap counts must top 900 adults before the province considers it at “moderate risk.” All lower counts are labelled as “low” or “uncertain risk.”\\n\\nOnly Tilston, Man., reaches close to those levels, with a trap there counting 863 adults so far.\\n\\nDiamondback moth\\n\\nThe news is similarly good for diamondback moth.\\n\\nOf 91 traps set this year, 64 have returned less than 10 moths so far.\\n\\n“That doesn’t mean don’t scout,” Gavloski said.\\n\\nA “moderate” population blew into the Interlake, also grazing the northern part of central Manitoba this year, he noted.\\n\\n“Just like bertha army worm, their major damage is really to the pods,” he added. “Now that we’re getting some rains, if you’ve got good soil moisture, canola can compensate very well for damage to flowers, to buds, leaf feeding. The one thing it can’t compensate well for is pod feeding.”\\n\\nGavloski encouraged producers to take that damage risk into account when deciding whether to spray.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nTrap counts may be low, but the province is also warning producers that traps are used for regional forecasting, not management field to field.\\n\\n“The data is really meant to get you looking in your fields to help you prioritize your monitoring,” Gavloski said. “You cannot make control decisions based on trap counts. The traps only collect male (bertha army worm) moths. The females are the ones that lay the eggs and they do not always lay their eggs in the same fields traps are in. In fact, there’s been many cases where fields that had a trap and had high trap counts had extremely low larval levels.”\\n\\nThe entomologist made a similar point for diamondback moth.\\n\\nProtect pollinators\\n\\nGavloski has also warned producers to stay away from tank mixing insecticide unless a pest has reached economic thresholds.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nProducers might cause an unintentional yield loss if that same insect management kills off pollinators, he said, since crops like canola have shown greater yield if there are pollinators present.\\n\\n“It’s enough of a yield bump that if you really aren’t at an economic threshold, tank mixing in that insecticide likely will be a losing proposition,” he said. “If you’re at the threshold for bertha army worm or diamondback moth or any of the other insects that time of year, then it may pay off.”\\n\\nThe entomologist suggests growers might expect a 10 to 15 per cent boost in yield from pollinators.',\n",

       "     'text': 'It’s not often you find yourself in the middle of a field with full Wi-Fi bars on your phone.\\n\\nBut what else would you expect from a ‘smart farm?’\\n\\n“This is the classroom coming alive,” said Jason Bradley, director of smart ag for Olds College. “The smart farm is a place where students can get their hands on the future of farming.”\\n\\nFree Wi-Fi only scratches the surface of what’s on offer at the new Olds College Smart Farm, a state-of-the-art operation that will give students hands-on experience with using the latest ag tech in farming operations.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe goal is not only to train students to use technology that’s available today, but on how to successfully incorporate new tech as it becomes available.\\n\\n“Disruption in the industry is occurring, and it’s only going to get quicker and quicker,” said college president Stuart Cullum. “Our students need to not only know how to work with current technology — they also need to know what’s coming and how to adapt to that.”\\n\\nIn the past, that’s been tricky, with new technologies hitting the market faster than post-secondary schools could teach them, Bradley added.\\n\\n“This is our opportunity to not only catch up to industry, but also to lead where that’s going,” he said.\\n\\nThe first phase of the multimillion-dollar project, launched late last month, is a 110-acre smart cropping operation. It includes soil monitors, digital weather stations, wireless grain bin sensors, multispectral imaging, precision ag tools, drones, management software, data analytics, and artificial intelligence — all linked over a Wi-Fi network.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhen complete, the smart farm will top out at more than 1,000 acres and include a livestock operation. In both, students will have a chance to use next-generation technologies that will become more commonplace over the next three to five years.\\n\\n“It’s about establishing practical skills for today, but it’s also about establishing skills and capabilities for them to evolve with the industry as it grows,” said Cullum.\\n\\nHands-on learning\\n\\nThat’s always been the cornerstone of the college’s approach to learning, said former student Nikki Szakaly.\\n\\n“As a student at Olds College, it was the hands-on opportunities that we were provided with to put our knowledge to use that created such an excellent learning environment,” said Szakaly, who now works as an Agri-Trend coach.\\n\\n“The skills and knowledge that I received through my education at Olds College has set me up for a very successful career.”\\n\\nTechnology is allowing producers to make better business decisions on their farms, and that’s only going to continue, said Szakaly.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Bringing the farm into the digital age is revolutionizing the day-to-day operations for multiple generations,” she said.\\n\\nThat will be even more important as the industry grows, said Cullum. It’s estimated there are nearly 60,000 agriculture industry jobs that are unfilled across the country today. But rising enrolment in post-secondary agriculture programs shows there is growing interest in ag careers.\\n\\n“Young people and even people who are looking to make transitions from other industries are seeing agriculture as a place to forge a career. That’s really exciting,” said Cullum.\\n\\n“You don’t have to be an actual producer to have an exciting career in agriculture.”\\n\\nThere’s a need for companies and industry to have a place where they can partner in developing, testing, scaling, and demonstrating that technology, he added.\\n\\n“We now have the opportunity for Olds College to facilitate engagement around the challenges in the industry that need to be solved in order for our industry to produce more using less,” he said. “This isn’t about just putting technology in a field. It’s about focusing on solving those challenges and problems.”\\n\\nThe driver isn’t just the availability of new technology, but the need to do more with less, said Bradley.\\n\\n“If we don’t learn how to do that — and if we don’t teach our students how to do that — we’re not meeting the big-picture needs of the industry.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Pearl Gregor was on the phone the instant she read about ALUS Canada in her county newspaper.\\n\\n“When I heard about ALUS, it was automatic — I had to do it,” said the New Sarepta-area cattle farmer.\\n\\n“We’ve lost so much of the Alberta wetlands. As farmers, we need water, so we need ALUS.”\\n\\nALUS (short for Alternative Land Use Services and pronounced ‘Alice’) compensates farmers and ranchers for providing ecosystem services on their land by contributing to up-front project costs and small annual payments. Common projects include improving riparian areas, maintaining native grasslands, and establishing wildlife habitats.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIn Gregor’s case, it meant fencing off her wetlands and providing an alternative watering source for her small herd.\\n\\n“People talk about the environment, but they very seldom do anything,” said Gregor, who manages her 240-acre farm with help from her son.\\n\\n“ALUS means I’ve got a little bit of wetland, and anyone else who joins might have a little bit of wetland. It just makes sense.”\\n\\nAfter launching in 2006 in Manitoba, ALUS came to Alberta in 2010 through a pilot project in the County of Vermilion River, before spreading to Parkland County in 2012 and Red Deer County in 2013. Today, there are 11 counties in Alberta that support ALUS programs, including the counties of Wetaskiwin and Leduc, where Gregor farms.\\n\\nGregor’s wetlands fencing was the first ALUS project completed in the region. Today, more than 300 acres are enrolled in the area.\\n\\n“It’s a win-win program,” said Kim Barkwell, sustainable agriculture program manager for the County of Wetaskiwin and Leduc County.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Greater society benefits from nature on the landscape, and most producers have some marginal areas on their land that they could enhance. It’s a program that just benefits everyone.”\\n\\nIn many cases, farmers already have some ecosystem services on their land and don’t realize it, said Barkwell. ALUS is a way to recognize the work that’s already being done, while also encouraging additional enhancements to the land.\\n\\n“ALUS is an excellent solution provider,” said Barkwell. “It’s a way to have both nature and productivity on your farm and get rewarded for it.”\\n\\nBig-picture thinking\\n\\nOn Gregor’s farm, the wetlands have already started to rebound in the two years since the fence was installed. Willows are growing again, water levels are up, wildflowers have spread, and ducks are back in their natural habitat.\\n\\n“You can already tell the difference it’s made in allowing the vegetation to come back,” said Barkwell. “It doesn’t take long for nature to do its thing.”\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nGregor drew on additional government funding to complete the project, Barkwell added. A Growing Forward 2 grant covered 70 per cent of the cost of the fencing, with the remaining 30 per cent being split between Gregor and ALUS. Gregor also receives a yearly per-acre payment for maintaining the wetlands (about $90 in her case).\\n\\nTypically, though, project participants aren’t motivated by the annual payment, said Barkwell.\\n\\n“It’s not about the money,” she said. “Our producers are appreciative of that cheque, but it’s not the only driver.”\\n\\nFor Gregor, the annual payment is a nice bonus, but she has a better reason for preserving her wetlands — water management.\\n\\n“If you want to maximize production on your land, you’re going to need water,” said Gregor.\\n\\n“Farmers need water. We have a vested interest in having a wetland that holds more moisture.”\\n\\nAs Gregor watches the ecosystem on her farm rebuild itself, she sees more and more the value in turning her marginal lands toward a different type of production.\\n\\n“My 3.5 acres haven’t been taken out of production. That 3.5 acres are in production to support the environment,” she said.\\n\\n“The wetlands are in the environment for a reason. The fact that we’ve paved over 80 per cent of them does not bode well for our future.\\n\\n“What will be left of this province in 100 years if we don’t take care of them?”\\n\\nThis project may seem like a drop in the bucket, but every little bit helps, she added.\\n\\n“My project is 3.5 acres, which is minuscule, but I’ve only got 240 acres of land,” said Gregor.\\n\\n“If everybody did one per cent of their own land, it would be quite a bit in the long run.\\n\\n“We’ve got to think of the big picture. I’m just doing what I can.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'This is the last blog post I’ll be writing from my preferred venue of the Starbucks in the base of one of Portage and Main’s towers.\\n\\nI’ll still be blogging and blithering in this digital space on the internet, but this physical space in the core of Winnipeg’s and Canada’s grain business is disappearing on Friday, when I’m out visiting a farm.\\n\\nIt’s being closed as a lot of motion is taking place around Portage and Main and downtown Winnipeg, as well as in the Canadian grain trade, and it feels like a perfect metaphor through which to reminisce on the changes of the last 10 years, on tumult, change, loss and gain.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nFor it was almost ten years ago I began blogging almost exclusively from this place, which is only a three minute walk from where my office was located, behind another of Portage and Main’s corners.\\n\\nFor some reason I found my new and exciting blog, born in late 2008 as I returned to work from an eight month parental leave, to be impossible to write in the bunged-up conditions of my office. I needed to feel free and relaxed, and this newish Starbucks provided the perfect atmosphere. It had opened a year or two before that, but neither I nor the barista that I just chatted with could recall precisely when. Such is the way of memory and life.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nFrom here I’ve blogged about a never-ending stream of agriculture and farm issues, from the worldwide economic crisis of 2008-09 (a favourite of mine), the despair and dismay in the hog industry due to cripplingly low profits, to Canada-U.S. trade troubles, to the (until 2011) never-ending war over the Canadian Wheat Board and the subsequent rise of a vibrant free market in wheat, barley and durum. I wrote about the revolutionary changes happening in derivatives markets and with futures exchanges, which were being swept up in a digital onslaught that was quickly breaking the hold century-old exchanges had over the trading of their particular commodities.\\n\\nThis place, these tables and wooden chairs, the comfy leatherish chairs, the windows looking out onto the towers of Portage and Main, have always seemed a natural place to be scribbling about these sorts of things. Right now I can see the big “R” on the Richardson Building, the headquarters of Canada’s most important grain company. Above me are the offices of Parrish and Heimbecker and Viterra – and it’s where Agricore United was once headquartered. The U.S. consulate is also straight above me.\\n\\nDown Main Street I can see the building housing the Canadian International Grains Institute and the Canadian Grain Commission. And there are many more ag-related interests all around here, too numerous to mention. In a five minute walk I could tour you through a string of analysts’ offices.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThis Starbucks is closing for reasons I don’t know, but stuff is shifting all around here. A big new office complex is being built right beside the Winnipeg Jets arena and some Portage and Main tenants have been lured down there, a few blocks away. This tower was the TD tower until recently, then I noticed the TD sign had leapt across Portage and Main to emblazon what I still insist on calling the Commodity Exchange Tower, and others still call the Trizec building, recalling functions of the past.\\n\\nThe Winnipeg Commodity Exchange was renamed and relocated years ago, following its move to all-electronic trading, and was lost to the Portage and Main area, moving out to a business strip mall about a mile from here. The exchange is now in the midst of moving to New York.\\n\\nAcross Portage and Main and through an underground concourse one can find the Cargill Building, which houses a reduced set of offices for the international grain company, which has been internationalizing and denationalizing its global offices in the last few years.\\n\\nSo there have been some losses and diminishment. But there have also been gains. The Richardson Empire has grown and concentrated itself here at Portage and Main. I can’t see it from here, but behind the Richardson building and down a block, construction is already well underway on the new Richardson Innovation Centre, which is bringing food scientists and demonstration labs and kitchens right into the heart of the grain trade. A number of grain trading, grain inspection, grain marketing and other grain-related enterprises have moved in or expanded in the years since I began blogging from this pleasant place. It’s not hard to find grainy people around here, and they’re often amongst those sipping coffee at tables beside me.\\n\\nI’m sad to see this place go. It didn’t quite make the 10 year anniversary of me doing this blog. But like everything at Portage and Main and in the Canadian grain trade, tumult is constant and flux is a fact of life. I’ll have to find somewhere else to muse and speculate and fulminate and rant from, but I suppose I can’t remain immune to the forces surrounding me, sweeping me along.',\n",

       "     'text': 'The discovery of genetically modified wheat growing in Alberta is disappointing and damaging to Canadian farmers.\\n\\nSo is the reaction by Cereals Canada, an industry-dominated group that falsely claims to represent Canadian wheat farmers.\\n\\nAn article published in 2014 quotes Cereals Canada President Cam Dahl saying, “Cereals Canada’s support for GM wheat is consistent with the policy of its member associations, which includes the Grain Growers, miller’s association and life science companies.”\\n\\nFollowing a GM wheat contamination incident in Oregon in 2014, Cereals Canada signed on to a statement in support of further investment in, and commercialization of, genetically modified wheat.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCereals Canada supported an irresponsible policy then and it hasn’t learned anything from Canada losing important markets now.\\n\\nEscapes of genetically modified plants and resulting market disruptions were predicted by the National Farmers Union 15 years ago.\\n\\nJapan, which was the highest-priced market when the Canadian Wheat Board was marketing Canadian wheat, has stopped all shipments of Canadian wheat and flour. South Korea also suspended Canadian wheat imports for a short time and other countries may follow.\\n\\nIn June, 2003, an NFU media release highlighted the unacceptable risks of GM wheat, calling it BSE for grain farmers because of the consequences GM wheat could bring should it escape and cause market closures.\\n\\nFollowing this latest discovery, Cereals Canada and its members were quick to revert to the “it’s all safe” biotech industry mantra, which ignores the very real market problems.\\n\\nTherein lies one of the central problems with Cereals Canada — some of its board members are in a conflict of interest. For a life science company, passing up an opportunity to sell more chemicals or seed would contradict the company’s interests.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThere is no question that the policies of Cereals Canada members, such as the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association and Grain Growers of Canada, helped provide Monsanto and the government the cover they needed to seed experimental plots of GM wheat at secret and undisclosed locations 15 years ago.\\n\\nThe farmer-run Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) also recognized the marketing liability that GM wheat posed. The CWB stood up for the interests of Canadian farmers and our international customers who do not want GM wheat.\\n\\nNo doubt its firm opposition to GM wheat is another reason why members of Cereals Canada worked so hard to destroy the CWB. Clearly, Cereals Canada cannot be trusted to represent the interests of Canadian wheat farmers.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nCereals Canada has worked against the interests of farmers on other issues, as well. By continually undermining the Canadian Grain Commission, and calling for U.S. grain to freely enter Canada and be commingled with Canadian grain, Cereals Canada promotes other irresponsible policies.\\n\\nRecently, Cereals Canada has embarked on a plan to merge with or take over the Canadian International Grains Institute. The farmer check-off money that helps support CIGI makes CIGI a target that is just too good to pass up. However, with the mission statement “to be the trusted, independent source for milling, quality and end-use functionality expertise for millers and end-users of Canadian grain,” CIGI does important work and it would be extremely damaging to have CIGI taking the same irresponsible policy positions endorsed by Cereals Canada.\\n\\nGiven its track record, Cereals Canada has no right to a merger or takeover of CIGI.\\n\\nStewart Wells was president of the National Farmers Union from 2001-09.',\n",

       "     'text': 'It was a warm few days of visiting, walking around, and watching farm equipment in action, as thousands of people from the agriculture community met in a field along Highway 16 northwest of Saskatoon this week for the 2018 edition of Ag in Motion (AIM).\\n\\nThe hot weather certainly put a premium on any space at the show that featured shade or a breeze. Some foreheads may have even surpassed the new machinery on the shiny-ness index on Tuesday, when temperatures soared into the 30s.\\n\\nWhile the heat served as a reminder of how refreshing a cold beverage can be at the end of the day, here are some of the other observations/things we picked up at this week’s show near Langham, Saskatchewan:\\n\\nThe real impact of industry consolidation is still to be determined and understood in several spaces in Canadian agriculture. AIM marked the first major show where Invigor and Bayer were physically separated, as the canola business is in transition between Bayer and BASF. There’s still a combination of excitement and uncertainty when speaking with people working for the brands involved in the current wave of mergers and acquisitions, whether that’s Bayer, Invigor, BASF, Monsanto, or even Corteva. The announcement on Tuesday of Clean Seed Capital’s acquisition of U.S. planter equipment manufacturer Harvest International also drew reaction from farmers — both positive and negative — with questions about what the implications of the deal will be.\\n\\nThe crop is extremely variable and largely dependent on having had one or two storms systems give it critically-timed moisture, but anecdotally, more farmers were optimistic about yield potential than we expected. With the clear exception of southwest Saskatchewan, where it’s very dry, we were surprised how often we heard the top end of the yield potential described as “excellent” and “very good.”\\n\\nFrustration is growing with unresolved trade issues with India and Italy. Pulses and durum are major exports for Saskatchewan farmers and as time passes, growers are increasingly concerned that these files are falling behind other topics for the federal government.\\n\\nSteel price increases are hitting manufacturers. Equipment-makers have tried to pre-buy as much steel as possible, but it’s inevitable that higher steel costs will be passed on.\\n\\nRow-crop planters are moving north and west. How many planters would there have been at a farm machinery show in the Saskatoon area five, even three years ago? We may have missed some, but there were at least four companies pitching planters and ideas of canola seed singulation/growing soybeans at AIM this year.\\n\\nFarmers don’t expect plots to be perfect. This is maybe for the marketing folks more than anyone… Hail hit most of the plots at AIM about 10 days before the show started. Some plots were pulled, but most were kept, and really, everybody understood and sympathized with why they looked the way they did. If nothing else, it showed how the plants respond to hail. None of the plots looked as bad as the west side of the Petro Canada gas station in Langham (the gas station probably did alright this week on sales of ice, water and Gatorade alone.)\\n\\nFinally, farmers still want to go to farm shows. While attendance has plateaued or dipped at other farm machinery shows due to multiple factors, the growth in Ag in Motion shows that farmers are still willing to spend a day or two looking at machinery and visiting, even driving long distances to do so. Retailers and manufacturers who want a better way to showcase their products also appreciate the space, plots and demos at AIM.\\n\\nWere you at Ag in Motion this week? What were your take-homes from the show? Feel free to comment below or send us an email at [email protected].',\n",

       "     'text': 'The Japanese government has ended its temporary suspension of Canadian wheat imports, just over a month after pausing purchases from Canada following the confirmation of a handful of unapproved genetically-modified wheat plants found growing in southern Alberta in 2017.\\n\\nThe country’s ministry of agriculture issued tenders for 62,957 tonnes of food-quality wheat from Canada on Friday, according to a report from Reuters.\\n\\n“Japan is a long-standing, premium customer of Canadian wheat and is the highest grade buyer of Canadian wheat in the world,” noted Cereals Canada president Cam Dahl, in a statement welcoming the Japanese decision on Friday.\\n\\n“We appreciate that loyalty and highly value the collaborative nature of our trading partnership,” he continued. “Cereals Canada is grateful for the effort that the Government of Japan has put into resolving this issue as quickly as possible, work that included travel to Canada by officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.”\\n\\nJapan halted purchases of Canadian wheat on June 15th, the day after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said a limited number of glyphosate-tolerant wheat plants were found growing along an oil site access road in southern Alberta last summer.\\n\\nThe CFIA says none of the wheat entered the grain handling or seed production system. Ongoing testing of shipments by the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) has found no evidence to suggest otherwise.\\n\\nJapanese officials traveled to Canada and met with Cereals Canada, the CGC, and the CFIA the following week. The CFIA also shared a validated test for the GM trait with Japan’s government.\\n\\nJapan has not found any GM wheat in its system, but has indicated it will continue to test shipments from Canada.\\n\\n“Today’s news proves that Canada’s science-based regulatory system works,” said Tom Steve, general manager of the Alberta Wheat Commission, on Friday. “Not only does Canada’s grain handling system employ some of the most rigorous quality control protocols in the world, but we also prioritize transparency with our customers. Japan is a highly valued customer of Canada and we are pleased to see that they have reaffirmed their confidence in our system and have resumed normal trade.”\\n\\nDahl also recognized the united approach the Canadian grain industry took to finding a resolution to Japan’s concerns:\\n\\n“Almost all organizations and companies have come together to present unified single Canadian industry message. As a united industry we are able to work with the government and our customers to help maintain our reputation as a reliable supplier.”\\n\\nTimeline for GM wheat case:\\n\\n(with info from the CFIA)\\n\\nSummer 2017: A custom applicator in southern Alberta reports wheat plants that survived a glyphosate herbicide treatment (Roundup) to local authorities. They were found growing along an access road to an oil site. The Alberta government collects samples for testing.\\n\\nJanuary 2018: The Alberta government confirms the wheat plants are herbicide tolerant.\\n\\nJanuary 31: The Alberta government informs the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) about finding a few herbicide-tolerant wheat plants in southern Alberta.\\n\\nFebruary 15: The CFIA confirms that Alberta’s samples are genetically modified (GM) and herbicide-tolerant.\\n\\nFebruary 16-20: The CFIA runs further tests and narrows a list of wheat lines that had been grown in research trials down to three belonging to two companies.\\n\\nFebruary 19: The CFIA informs Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and Health Canada (HC). Risk and safety assessments of the wheat begin for human health, the health of animals and the environment.\\n\\nFebruary 22: CFIA contacts both companies, including Monsanto, to obtain samples from possible wheat lines.\\n\\nMarch 13: The CFIA rules out one company after testing its samples and determining that it is not a match for this GM wheat.\\n\\nMarch 23: Testing by the CFIA and Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) confirms that this GM wheat does not match any of the 450 registered wheat seed varieties sold in Canada.\\n\\nMarch 28: The CFIA confirms that the herbicide-tolerant wheat was not a match with previous incidents in the U.S.\\n\\nApril 6: The CFIA concludes development and validation of a testing method to detect this GM wheat.\\n\\nApril 6: The CFIA receives samples from Monsanto to test the other possible wheat lines.\\n\\nApril 8: Testing by the CFIA confirms that the wheat contained genetic elements that match an event provided by Monsanto. This event (MON71200) is not approved in any registered wheat variety. Monsanto says this event was field tested in Canada from 1998 to 2000. The company dropped it from its research in the latter years of its glyphosate-tolerant wheat program, which ended in Canada in 2004. The nearest trial site where Monsanto tested this event was located hundreds of miles away from where these plants were discovered, according to CFIA officials. The plants also do not match the type of wheat that Monsanto tested the trait in in Canada.\\n\\nApril 9: The CFIA receives and begins testing CGC’s wheat samples from their 2017 Harvest Sample Program.\\n\\nApril 20: The landowner is informed of the finding. The CFIA collects information to identify possible scope and presence of this GM wheat.\\n\\nApril 20-25: Seed and grain samples from the landowner’s farm are collected and sent to CFIA lab to test for this GM wheat.\\n\\nMay 1: Results of all seed and grain samples taken on farm are negative for this GM wheat.\\n\\nMay 8: Wheat heads from field surrounding the access road are dry enough for the CFIA to collect and test.\\n\\nMay 9: HC and CFIA complete risk and safety assessments of this wheat. This trait does not pose a risk to public health, health of animals or the environment.\\n\\nMay 23: Testing of wheat heads is completed.

       "     'text': 'Clean Seed Capital Group — the Canadian company behind the CX-6 Smart Seeder — has announced a deal to acquire U.S. planter equipment manufacturer Harvest International.\\n\\nThe company also debuted the first Clean Seed Smart Planter at Ag in Motion on Tuesday, built with Harvest International technology.\\n\\n“Following the granting of Clean Seed patents in the United States, we sought to find a synergistic industry partner with respected roots in the U.S. who would position us for accelerated growth and innovation,” says Graeme Lempriere, president and CEO of Clean Seed, announcing the agreement on Tuesday morning. “Their industry experience, proven technology and aligned core values made Harvest International the perfect fit. We collectively recognize the significance of the opportunity to cross-pollinate our robust and industry leading intellectual property portfolios in the North American seeder and planter markets.”\\n\\nColin Rush, chief operating officer for Clean Seed, explains how the deal with Harvest International came together, and plans for combining the two companies with RealAg’s Kelvin Heppner at Ag in Motion:\\n\\nBased in Storm Lake, Iowa, Harvest International was founded in 2007 by the same Friesen family that started Meridian Industries in 1963, and later, Friesen of Iowa. (continues below.)\\n\\nHarvest International originally manufactured augers and conveyor systems, but switched its business in 2014 to focus on planter technology, securing patents for planter row unit components. The auger and conveyor business was sold in 2017.\\n\\n“Harvest International has a proud history of farmer-focused innovations in agricultural manufacturing and intellectual property development,” says Byron Friesen, president of Harvest International, who will remain in a senior management role and join the Clean Seed board of directors. “This acquisition allows us to grow and join forces with a like-minded tech forward company to deliver innovations not yet seen by North American farmers.”\\n\\nHarvest International has a 75,000 square foot manufacturing facility and office in Storm Lake.\\n\\nLempriere says the acquisition is “best described as a merger of two cutting-edge technology pioneers of the agricultural industry… We look forward to accessing an extensive U.S. market and community as well as executing on future plans to bring proven planter technology north into Canada. The combination our of strong intellectual properties and innovative technologies opens the door to provide significant marketplace advantage for Clean Seed.”\\n\\nByron Friesen, president and CEO of Harvest International, discusses the deal with Clean Seed:\\n\\nClean Seed says the purchase price for Harvest International includes the following:\\n\\nthe issuance of 8,000,000 Clean Seed common shares at closing, which will be subject to the standard four month hold period under applicable securities laws and TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) rules;\\n\\na cash payment at closing of US$2,580,718, subject to customary closing adjustments;\\n\\nthe assumption or restructuring at closing of notes payable of Harvest International and an affiliate aggregating approximately US$7,519,282;\\n\\nfuture additional cash payments of up to US$6,000,000, based on Harvest International’s achievement of certain earn-out performance milestones, which will be paid out at the earliest in US$2,000,000 annual installments over a three year period from December 31, 2019.\\n\\nThe acquisition is still subject to regulatory and financing approvals. Clean Seed says it expects to close the deal in late 2018.\\n\\nTrading of Clean Seed shares on the TSX-V was halted last week to mitigate any potential trading issues in the case the first Clean Seed planter unit was spotted crossing the border into Canada for Ag in Motion, according to the company. Trading will resume after the exchange has the required documentation regarding the acquisition.',\n",

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham in Vancouver on Thursday and Friday.\\n\\nThe topics discussed at the annual ministerial get-together included trade, business risk management, labour, and the legalization of cannabis.\\n\\nHere’s a summary of what was discussed at the meeting:\\n\\nTrade\\n\\nThe ministers received an update on the NAFTA talks from Canada’s negotiators, and reiterated their commitment to working together in the ongoing negotiations.\\n\\nRegarding the CPTPP, with Singapore ratifying the trade deal this week, there are now three countries that have approved the agreement that takes effect when six countries approve it domestically. Federal Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay told reporters after the meeting in Vancouver that Canada is still aiming to be among the first six countries.\\n\\n“We will have it ratified as soon as we possibly can. It will be very shortly,” said MacAulay.\\n\\nBusiness risk management (BRM)\\n\\nThe ministers agreed at their annual meeting in July 2017 to undertake a year-long review of AgriStability, AgriInvest and the other BRM programs under the federal-provincial Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP). An expert panel that was created to guide the review shared its final report and recommendations with the ministers on Friday, specifically urging them to make changes to AgriStability.\\n\\nThe ministers acknowledged the concerns of some of the panel members who felt the review was still incomplete. Rather than extending the expert panel’s mandate however, the ministers directed government officials to continue working on the panel’s recommendations and report back in 2019.\\n\\nMacAulay also announced $55 million for a renewed AgriRisk program under CAP to “encourage partnerships between agriculture industry stakeholders, researchers, and federal, provincial and territorial governments to proactively explore and develop new risk management products and services.”\\n\\nThe federal minister described the $55 million program as a response to a recommendation from the BRM expert panel, with the funding earmarked for developing programs if there are sectors that wish to top-up existing programs or address gaps in risk management.\\n\\nThis AgriRisk funding will be available for two areas: research and development, and administrative capacity building, with priority given to proposals for industry-led projects that develop new and innovative business risk management tools.\\n\\nWhen asked whether the ministers worked on a contingency plan to support Canadian farmers if the U.S. government follows through with its promise to compensate its farmers for the impact of Chinese tariffs, MacAulay referred to existing programs under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, which includes AgriStability, AgriInvest and AgriRecovery.\\n\\n“We’re not going to speculate on what might develop, but there’s a framework in place with the Canadian Agricultural Partnership now,” said the minister. “There is a system in place to make sure, if we hit any major problems, that we’re able to deal with it.”\\n\\nLabour\\n\\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada says the ministers discussed the labour shortage in agriculture, the use of temporary foreign workers, agreed to continue to monitor the situation, and approved a work plan to “further develop strategies and engage industries on labour issues.”\\n\\nCannabis\\n\\nFederal officials provided an update to the ministers on the legalization of marijuana, set to happen in October. The cannabis industry will be eligible to apply for federal funding under CAP. Provinces will have discretion on eligibility for programs that are cost-shared between the federal and provincial governments.\\n\\nIncome from cannabis will not be eligible for coverage under AgriStability and AgriInvest, although the ministers said they will monitor this as the industry matures.\\n\\n“It’s important to realize cannabis is an agricultural product. Like any other agricultural product it’s open to other programs,” said MacAulay.\\n\\nOther topics\\n\\nThe ministers also discussed regulatory issues, including ways to streamline regulations, the creation of a Canadian Plant Health Council under the Plant and Animal Health Strategy for Canada, finalizing a national traceability system, and implementing the new Safe Food for Canadians Regulations.\\n\\nThe ministers also received an update from the federal government on the creation of the national food policy.\\n\\nNext year\\n\\nThe 2019 ag ministers’ meeting is slated to be held in Quebec City next July.',\n",

In a pulse crop, it is particularly important because pulses fix their own nitrogen and you have to actually see the roots to know what is going on.\\n\\nIn this episode of the Pulse School, field editor Dale Leftwich talks to Wendy Schatz Leeds, lead agronomist with Sharpe’s Crop Services, about nodulation.\\n\\nWhat is the right time to scout a pea field for nodulation and what are the things to look for?\\n\\nThe field Schatz Leeds is scouting (above) is a little more mature than when you would usually start assessing your inoculant and nodulation, but continued monitoring is helpful and informative.\\n\\nAccording to Schatz Leeds. “Nodules set just when it starts to actively grow and elongate, but it’s still nice to see if they are fixing nitrogen so I always dig up a plant, look for good nodulation on the root system and slice open a nodule and look for the blood red colour to see if it’s fixing.”\\n\\nThe first thing to check is for the presences of nodules and that they are evenly distributed throughout the root system. Schatz Leeds says “I want nodules both on the crown and along all the secondary roots, which is what we see, and we also look for healthy nodulation.”\\n\\nThe second thing to check is to make sure the nodules aren’t freeloaders. That is, taking energy from the plant and making nodules, but not fixing nitrogen for the plant.\\n\\nWhen broken open the nodules should be blood red inside. Schatz Leeds says “Red colour is important. It shows it is fixing nitrogen.”\\n\\nWhat could it mean if you don’t have decent nodulation?

       "     'text': 'Optical sensors for selective weed control aren’t new, but the technology has come a long way in recent years. A new offering, the WEEDIt system, caught farmers’ attention at the recent CanolaPalooza field day event held at Lacombe, Alberta.\\n\\nTo explain how the WEEDIt works, we caught up with Tom Wolf, with AgriMetrix. “It’s an optical spray system that targets anything green on a non-green background,” he says. The spray boom is fitted with sensors ahead of nozzles spaced 8″ apart. When a sensor detects something green it triggers the nozzle behind it to fire.\\n\\nWolf says that the WEEDIt is proving itself a real time and product saver, and could have a significant impact on herbicide resistance management, as well.\\n\\nBecause of the need for a non-green background, the system has a place in pre-seed burn-off, chem fallow, and post-harvest applications, Wolf says. Some farmers are achieving a 75% reduction in chemical use in pre-seeding passes. This is a good news story on many fronts, of course, but Wolf could see where those savings may be leveraged to add in some pricier — but very effective in the fight against resistance — chemical options.\\n\\nIt’s a good news story when it comes to stewardship, of course, as any time we can conserve chemical use, but still achieve top productivity, that’s a win, Wolf says.\\n\\nThere’s also a productivity gain, Wolf says, as some farmers are finding the decreased product demand can mean a tank takes an hour and a half to empty over enough ground vs. 25 to 30 minutes. That can add up to significant productivity gains in the already time-crunched spring.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Can you tell the difference between annual ryegrass and cereal rye? How about radish and kale?\\n\\nIf you can’t, it’s time to bone up on your identification skills if you want to get serious about planting cover crops mixes on your farm, says Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs soil management specialist Anne Verhallen. At the recent FarmSmart Expo in Elora, Verhallen quizzed farmers on their species identification skills and emphasized the importance of knowing what you’re growing.\\n\\n“There are a number of different cover crops that are being used in mixes,” says Verhallen. “You can tell them apart at the seedling stage or shortly after the seedling stage. It’s important to know those stages and be able to recognize them at those points in order to craft your termination plan.”\\n\\nIn this video, Verhallen offers identification tips for nine different common cover crops and how growers can peg them at the seedling stage. One of those tips is how to tell the difference between ryegrass and cereal rye. “They are totally different grasses with very different control methods,” says Verhallen. “It’s importance to recognize the difference and recognize them when they are in the mix because that’s going to change the termination method.”',\n",

       "     'text': 'Every farmer doesn’t need to own and operate a drone for UAV technology to have a positive impact on their farm.\\n\\nThat’s the message Scott Ditschun shares with farmers when he discusses how Bayer CropScience is employing drones in its agronomic and product research. He says UAV technology could effectively increase Bayer’s field research efficiency by a factor of 10.\\n\\nAt the company’s annual Dead Weeds Tour, Ditschun, an agronomic development representative focussing on seed treatments and foliar fungicides, explained how drones can greatly enhance field trial research that’s traditionally been carried out by human scouts.\\n\\n“This drone can basically take the human element out of these trials,” says Ditschun noting the flying machine’s ability to calculate corn stand counts, gather biomass index and NDVI ratings as well as measure plant height and canopy volume.\\n\\n“It can go through a one-acre field in about five minutes and take six measurements where it would take two of my students about an hour to do one measurement,” says Ditschun. It’s allowing us to take a lot more data, and gather it at a fraction of the time.”\\n\\nThe fully loaded DJI S1000 drone, which comes with GPS, high resolution and sensor cameras, and software from aerial robots partner Precision Silver, costs about $30,000.\\n\\nDitschun acknowledges that this type of investment doesn’t make sense for a farmer, but companies like Bayer have the ability to integrate the technology into their research program and produce benefits that impact crop production.\\n\\nStory continues after this video.\\n\\nDitchun is excited about the ability of drone research to give his company more and better agronomic information to provide enhanced management advice to its customers. For example, he notes that drone research could greatly increase Bayer’s ability to provide growers agronomic management advice for a product like metribuzin herbicide, which is sensitive to some soybean varieties.\\n\\n“Because we are increasing the efficiency by a factor of 10, we could in theory do 10 times more varieties or 10 times more repeated trials across different soil types,” says Ditschun. “That would be really important for a product like metribuzin, which is impacted by soil conditions and soil type.',\n",
